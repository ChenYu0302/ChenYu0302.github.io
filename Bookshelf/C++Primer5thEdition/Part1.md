## Preface 

Countless programmers have learned C++ from previous editions of *C++ Primer*. During that time, C++ has matured greatly: Its focus, and that of its programming community, has widened from looking mostly at machine efficiency to devoting more attention to programmer efficiency.

In 2011, the C++ standards committee issued a major revision to the ISO C++ standard. This revised standard is latest step in C++‚Äôs evolution and continues the emphasis on programmer efficiency. The primary goals of the new standard are to

- Make the language more uniform and easier to teach and to learn
- Make the standard libraries easier, safer, and more efficient to use
- Make it easier to write efficient abstractions and libraries

In this edition, we have completely revised the *C++ Primer* to use the latest standard. You can get an idea of how extensively the new standard has affected C++ by reviewing the New Features Table of Contents, which lists the sections that cover new material and appears on page xxi.

Some additions in the new standard, such as `auto` for type inference, are pervasive. These facilities make the code in this edition easier to read and to understand. Programs (and programmers!) can ignore type details, which makes it easier to concentrate on what the program is intended to do. Other new features, such as smart pointers and move-enabled containers, let us write more sophisticated classes without having to contend with the intricacies of resource management. As a result, we can start to teach how to write your own classes much earlier in the book than we did in the Fourth Edition. We‚Äîand you‚Äîno longer have to worry about many of the details that stood in our way under the previous standard.

üÜïWe‚Äôve marked those parts of the text that cover features defined by the new standard, with a marginal icon. We hope that readers who are already familiar with the core of C++ will find these alerts useful in deciding where to focus their attention. We also expect that these icons will help explain error messages from compilers that might not yet support every new feature. Although nearly all of the examples in this book have been compiled under the current release of the GNU compiler, we realize some readers will not yet have access to completely updated compilers. Even though numerous capabilities have been added by the latest standard, the core language remains unchanged and forms the bulk of the material that we cover. Readers can use these icons to note which capabilities may not yet be available in their compiler.

### Why Read This Book?

Modern C++ can be thought of as comprising three parts:

- The low-level language, much of which is inherited from C
- More advanced language features that allow us to define our own types and to organize large-scale programs and systems
- The standard library, which uses these advanced features to provide useful data structures and algorithms

Most texts present C++ in the order in which it evolved. They teach the C subset of C++ first, and present the more abstract features of C++ as advanced topics at the end of the book. There are two problems with this approach: Readers can get bogged down in the details inherent in low-level programming and give up in frustration. Those who do press on learn bad habits that they must unlearn later.

We take the opposite approach: Right from the start, we use the features that let programmers ignore the details inherent in low-level programming. For example, we introduce and use the library `string` and `vector` types along with the built-in arithmetic and array types. Programs that use these library types are easier to write, easier to understand, and much less error-prone.

Too often, the library is taught as an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù topic. Instead of using the library, many books use low-level programming techniques based on pointers to character arrays and dynamic memory management. Getting programs that use these low-level techniques to work correctly is much harder than writing the corresponding C++ code using the library.

Throughout *C++ Primer*, we emphasize good style: We want to help you, the reader, develop good habits immediately and avoid needing to unlearn bad habits as you gain more sophisticated knowledge. We highlight particularly tricky matters and warn about common misconceptions and pitfalls.

We also explain the rationale behind the rules‚Äîexplaining the why not just the what. We believe that by understanding why things work as they do, readers can more quickly cement their grasp of the language.

Although you do not need to know C in order to understand this book, we assume you know enough about programming to write, compile, and run a program in at least one modern block-structured language. In particular, we assume you have used variables, written and called functions, and used a compiler.

### Changes to the Fifth Edition

New to this edition of *C++ Primer* are icons in the margins to help guide the reader. C++ is a large language that offers capabilities tailored to particular kinds of programming problems. Some of these capabilities are of great import for large project teams but might not be necessary for smaller efforts. As a result, not every programmer needs to know every detail of every feature. We‚Äôve added these marginal icons to help the reader know which parts can be learned later and which topics are more essential.

üìñWe‚Äôve marked sections that cover the fundamentals of the language with an image of a person studying a book. The topics covered in sections marked this way form the core part of the language. Everyone should read and understand these sections.

üìöWe‚Äôve also indicated those sections that cover advanced or special-purpose topics. These sections can be skipped or skimmed on a first reading. We‚Äôve marked such sections with a stack of books to indicate that you can safely put down the book at that point. It is probably a good idea to skim such sections so you know that the capability exists. However, there is no reason to spend time studying these topics until you actually need to use the feature in your own programs.

üîçTo help readers guide their attention further, we‚Äôve noted particularly tricky concepts with a magnifying-glass icon. We hope that readers will take the time to understand thoroughly the material presented in the sections so marked. In at least some of these sections, the import of the topic may not be readily apparent; but we think you‚Äôll find that these sections cover topics that turn out to be essential to understanding the language.

Another aid to reading this book, is our extensive use of cross-references. We hope these references will make it easier for readers to dip into the middle of the book, yet easily jump back to the earlier material on which later examples rely.

What remains unchanged is that *C++ Primer* is a clear, correct, and thorough tutorial guide to C++. We teach the language by presenting a series of increasingly sophisticated examples, which explain language features and show how to make the best use of C++.

### Structure of This Book

We start by covering the basics of the language and the library together in Parts I and II. These parts cover enough material to let you, the reader, write significant programs. Most C++ programmers need to know essentially everything covered in this portion of the book.

In addition to teaching the basics of C++, the material in Parts I and II serves another important purpose: By using the abstract facilities defined by the library, you will become more comfortable with using high-level programming techniques. The library facilities are themselves abstract data types that are usually written in C++. The library can be defined using the same class-construction features that are available to any C++ programmer. Our experience in teaching C++ is that by first using well-designed abstract types, readers find it easier to understand how to build their own types.

Only after a thorough grounding in using the library‚Äîand writing the kinds of abstract programs that the library allows‚Äîdo we move on to those C++ features that will enable you to write your own abstractions. Parts III and IV focus on writing abstractions in the form of classes. Part III covers the fundamentals; Part IV covers more specialized facilities.

In Part III, we cover issues of copy control, along with other techniques to make classes that are as easy to use as the built-in types. Classes are the foundation for object-oriented and generic programming, which we also cover in Part III. C++ *Primer* concludes with Part IV, which covers features that are of most use in structuring large, complicated systems. We also summarize the library algorithms in Appendix A.

### Aids to the Reader

Each chapter concludes with a summary, followed by a glossary of defined terms, which together recap the chapter‚Äôs most important points. Readers should use these sections as a personal checklist: If you do not understand a term, restudy the corresponding part of the chapter.

We‚Äôve also incorporated a number of other learning aids in the body of the text:

- Important terms are indicated in **bold**; important terms that we assume are already familiar to the reader are indicated in ***bold italics***. Each term appears in the chapter‚Äôs Defined Terms section.
- Throughout the book, we highlight parts of the text to call attention to important aspects of the language, warn about common pitfalls, suggest good programming practices, and provide general usage tips.
- To make it easier to follow the relationships among features and concepts, we provide extensive forward and backward cross-references.
- We provide sidebar discussions on important concepts and for topics that new C++ programmers often find most difficult.
- Learning any programming language requires writing programs. To that end, the Primer provides extensive examples throughout the text. Source code for the extended examples is available on the Web at the following URL: http://www.informit.com/title/032174113

### A Note about Compilers

As of this writing (July, 2012), compiler vendors are hard at work updating their compilers to match the latest ISO standard. The compiler we use most frequently is the GNU compiler, version 4.7.0. There are only a few features used in this book that this compiler does not yet implement: inheriting constructors, reference qualifiers for member functions, and the regular-expression library.

### Acknowledgments

In preparing this edition we are very grateful for the help of several current and former members of the standardization committee: Dave Abrahams, Andy Koenig, Stephan T. Lavavej, Jason Merrill, John Spicer, and Herb Sutter. They provided invaluable assistance to us in understanding some of the more subtle parts of the new standard. We‚Äôd also like to thank the many folks who worked on updating the GNU compiler making the standard a reality.

As in previous editions of *C++ Primer*, we‚Äôd like to extend our thanks to Bjarne Stroustrup for his tireless work on C++ and for his friendship to the authors during most of that time. We‚Äôd also like to thank Alex Stepanov for his original insights that led to the containers and algorithms at the core of the standard library. Finally, our thanks go to all the C++ Standards committee members for their hard work in clarifying, refining, and improving C++ over many years.

## Chapter 1. Getting Started 

This chapter introduces most of the basic elements of C++: types, variables, expressions, statements, and functions. Along the way, we‚Äôll briefly explain how to compile and execute a program.

After having read this chapter and worked through the exercises, you should be able to write, compile, and execute simple programs. Later chapters will assume that you can use the features introduced in this chapter, and will explain these features in more detail.

The way to learn a new programming language is to write programs. In this chapter, we‚Äôll write a program to solve a simple problem for a bookstore.

Our store keeps a file of transactions, each of which records the sale of one or more copies of a single book. Each transaction contains three data elements:<br>
**0-201-70353-X 4 24.99**<br>
The first element is an ISBN (International Standard Book Number, a unique book identifier), the second is the number of copies sold, and the last is the price at which each of these copies was sold. From time to time, the bookstore owner reads this file and for each book computes the number of copies sold, the total revenue from that book, and the average sales price.

To be able to write this program, we need to cover a few basic C++ features. In addition, we‚Äôll need to know how to compile and execute a program.

Although we haven‚Äôt yet designed our program, it‚Äôs easy to see that it must

- Define variables
- Do input and output
- Use a data structure to hold the data
- Test whether two records have the same ISBN
- Contain a loop that will process every record in the transaction file

We‚Äôll start by reviewing how to solve these subproblems in C++ and then write our bookstore program.

### 1.1. Writing a Simple C++ Program 

Every C++ program contains one or more **functions**, one of which must be named `main`. The operating system runs a C++ program by calling `main`. Here is a simple version of main that does nothing but return a value to the operating system:

```c++
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

A function definition has four elements: a **return type**, a **function name**, a (possibly empty) parameter list enclosed in parentheses, and a function body. Although `main` is special in some ways, we define `main` the same way we define any other function.

In this example, `main` has an empty list of parameters (shown by the () with nothing inside). ¬ß 6.2.5 (p. 218) will discuss the other parameter types that we can define for `main`.

The `main` function is required to have a return type of `int`, which is a type that represents integers. The `int` type is a **built-in type**, which means that it is one of the types the language defines.

The final part of a function definition, the function body, is a **block** of **statements** starting with an open curly brace and ending with a **close curly**:

```C++
{
    return 0;
}
```

The only statement in this block is a `return`, which is a statement that terminates a function. As is the case here, a `return` can also send a value back to the function‚Äôs caller. When a `return` statement includes a value, the value returned must have a type that is compatible with the return type of the function. In this case, the return type of main is `int` and the return value is 0, which is an `int`.

> üìù**Note**
>
> Note the semicolon at the end of the `return` statement. Semicolons mark the end of most statements in C++. They are easy to overlook but, when forgotten, can lead to mysterious compiler error messages.

On most systems, the value returned from `main` is a status indicator. A return value of 0 indicates success. A nonzero return has a meaning that is defined by the system. Ordinarily a nonzero return indicates what kind of error occurred.

> **Key Concept: Types**
>
> Types are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming and a concept that we will come back to over and over in this Primer. A type defines both the contents of a data element and the operations that are possible on those data.
>
> The data our programs manipulate are stored in variables and every variable has a type. When the type of a variable named `v` is `T`, we often say that ‚Äúv has type T‚Äù or, interchangeably, that ‚Äúv is a T.‚Äù

#### 1.1.1 Compiling and Executing Our Program

Having written the program, we need to compile it. How you compile a program depends on your operating system and compiler. For details on how your particular compiler works, check the reference manual or ask a knowledgeable colleague.

Many PC-based compilers are run from an integrated development environment (IDE) that bundles the compiler with build and analysis tools. These environments can be a great asset in developing large programs but require a fair bit of time to learn how to use effectively. Learning how to use such environments is well beyond the scope of this book.

Most compilers, including those that come with an IDE, provide a command-line interface. Unless you already know the IDE, you may find it easier to start with the command-line interface. Doing so will let you concentrate on learning C++ first. Moreover, once you understand the language, the IDE is likely to be easier to learn.

##### Program Source File Naming Convention

Whether you use a command-line interface or an IDE, most compilers expect program source code to be stored in one or more files. Program files are normally referred to as a **source files**. On most systems, the name of a source file ends with a suffix, which is a period followed by one or more characters. The suffix tells the system that the file is a C++ program. Different compilers use different suffix conventions; the most common include `¬∑`, `.cxx`, `.cpp`, `.cp`, and `.C`.

##### Running the Compiler from the Command Line

If we are using a command-line interface, we will typically compile a program in a console window (such as a shell window on a UNIX system or a Command Prompt window on Windows). Assuming that our `main` program is in a file named `prog1.cc`, we might compile it by using a command such as

```shell
$ CC prog1.cc
```

where `CC` names the compiler and `$` is the system prompt. The compiler generates an executable file. On a Windows system, that executable file is named `prog1.exe`. UNIX compilers tend to put their executables in files named `a.out`.

To run an executable on Windows, we supply the executable file name and can omit the `.exe` file extension:

```powershell
$ prog1
```

On some systems you must specify the file‚Äôs location explicitly, even if the file is in the current directory or folder. In such cases, we would write

```powershell
$ .\prog1
```

The ‚Äú.‚Äù followed by a backslash indicates that the file is in the current directory.

To run an executable on UNIX, we use the full file name, including the file extension:

```shell
$ a.out
```

If we need to specify the file‚Äôs location, we‚Äôd use a ‚Äú.‚Äù followed by a forward slash to indicate that our executable is in the current directory:

```shell
$ ./a.out
```

The value returned from `main` is accessed in a system-dependent manner. On both UNIX and Windows systems, after executing the program, you must issue an appropriate `echo` command.

On UNIX systems, we obtain the status by writing

```shell
$ echo $?
```

To see the status on a Windows system, we write

```powershell
$ echo %ERRORLEVEL%
```

> **Running the GNU or Microsoft Compilers**
>
> The command used to run the C++ compiler varies across compilers and operating systems. The most common compilers are the GNU compiler and the Microsoft Visual Studio compilers. By default, the command to run the GNU compiler is `g++`:
>
> ```powershell
> $ g++ -o prog1 prog1.cc
> ```
>
> Here `$` is the system prompt. The `-o prog1` is an argument to the compiler and names the file in which to put the executable file. This command generates an executable file named `prog1` or `prog1.exe`, depending on the operating system. On UNIX, executable files have no suffix; on Windows, the suffix is `.exe`. If the `-o prog1` is omitted, the compiler generates an executable named a.out on UNIX systems and a.exe on Windows. (Note: Depending on the release of the GNU compiler you are using, you may need to specify `-std=c++0x` to turn on C++ 11 support.)
>
> The command to run the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 compiler is cl:
>
> ```powershell
> C:\Users\me\Programs> cl /EHsc prog1.cpp
> ```
>
> Here `C:\Users\me\Programs>` is the system prompt and `\Users\me\Programs` is the name of the current directory (aka the current folder). The cl command invokes the compiler, and `/EHsc` is the compiler option that turns on standard exception handling. The Microsoft compiler automatically generates an executable with a name that corresponds to the first source file name. The executable has the suffix .`exe` and the same name as the source file name. In this case, the executable is named `prog1.exe`.
>
> Compilers usually include options to generate warnings about problematic constructs. It is usually a good idea to use these options. Our preference is to use -`Wall` with the GNU compiler, and to use `/W4` with the Microsoft compilers.
>
> For further information consult your compiler‚Äôs user‚Äôs guide.

> **Exercises Section 1.1.1**
>
> **Exercise 1.1**: Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the `main` program from page 2.
>
> **Exercise 1.2**: Change the program to return `-1`. A return value of `-1` is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from `main`.

### 1.2. A First Look at Input/Output 

The C++ language does not define any statements to do input or 
output 
(IO). 
Instead, 
C++ 
includes 
an 
extensive 
standard 
library 
that 
provides 
IO 
(and 
many 
other 
facilities). 
For 
many 
purposes, including the examples in this book, one needs to know only a few basic concepts and operations from the IO library. 
Most of the examples in this book use the iostream 
library. Fundamental to the iostream library are two types named istream 
and ostream, which represent input and output streams, respectively. A stream is a sequence of characters read from or written to an IO device. The term stream is intended to suggest that the characters are generated, or consumed, sequentially over time. 
Standard Input and Output Objects 
The library defines four IO objects. To handle input, we use an object of type istream named cin 
(pronounced see-in). This object is also referred to as the standard 
input. For output, we use an ostream object named cout 
(pronounced see-out). This object is also known as the standard 
output. The library also defines two other ostream objects, named cerr 
and clog 
(pronounced see-err and see-log, respectively). We typically use cerr, referred to as the standard 
error, for warning and error messages and clog for general information about the execution of the program. 
Ordinarily, the system associates each of these objects with the window in which the program is executed. So, when we read from cin, data are read from the window in which the program is executing, and when we write to cout, cerr, or clog, the output is written to the same window. 
A Program That Uses the IO Library 
In our bookstore problem, we'll have several records that we'll want to combine into a single total. As a simpler, related problem, let's look first at how we might add two numbers. Using the IO library, we can extend our main program to prompt the user to give us two numbers and then print their sum: 

#include <iostream> 
int main() 
{ 
std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl; 
int v1 = 0, v2 = 0; 
std::cin >> v1 >> v2; 
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1 << " and " << v2 
<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl; 
return 0; 
} 
This program starts by printing 
Enter two numbers: 
on the user's screen and then waits for input from the user. If the user enters 
37 
followed by a newline, then the program produces the following output: 
The sum of 3 and 7 is 10 
The first line of our program 
#include <iostream> 
tells the compiler that we want to use the iostream library. The name inside angle brackets (iostream in this case) refers to a header. Every program that uses a library facility must include its associated header. The #include directive must be written on a single line'the name of the header and the #include must appear on the same line. In general, #include directives must appear outside any function. Typically, we put all the #include directives for a program at the beginning of the source file. 

Writing to a Stream 
The first statement in the body of main executes an expression. In C++ an expression yields a result and is composed of one or more operands and (usually) an operator. The expressions in this statement use the output operator (the . operator) to print a message on the standard output: 
std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl; 
The << operator takes two operands: The left-hand operand must be an ostream object; the right-hand operand is a value to print. The operator writes the given value on the given ostream. The result of the output operator is its left-hand operand. That is, the result is the ostream on which we wrote the given value. 
Our output statement uses the << operator twice. Because the operator returns its left-hand operand, the result of the first operator becomes the left-hand operand of the second. As a result, we can chain together output requests. Thus, our expression is equivalent to 
(std::cout << "Enter two numbers:") << std::endl; 
Each operator in the chain has the same object as its left-hand operand, in this case std::cout. Alternatively, we can generate the same output using two statements: 
std::cout << "Enter two numbers:"; 
std::cout << std::endl; 
The first output operator prints a message to the user. That message is a string 
literal, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotation marks. The text between the quotation marks is printed to the standard output. 
The second operator prints endl, which is a special value called a manipulator. Writing endl has the effect of ending the current line and flushing the buffer 
associated with that device. 
Flushing the buffer ensures that all the output the program has generated so far is actually written to the output stream, rather than sitting in memory waiting to be written. 


Warning 
Programmers often add print statements during debugging. Such statements should always flush the stream. Otherwise, if the program crashes, output may be left in the buffer, leading to incorrect inferences about where the program crashed. 

Using Names from the Standard Library 
Careful readers will note that this program uses std::cout and std::endl rather than just cout and endl. The prefix std:: indicates that the names cout and endl are defined inside the namespace 
named std. Namespaces allow us to avoid inadvertent collisions between the names we define and uses of those same names inside a library. All the names defined by the standard library are in the std namespace. 
One side effect of the library's use of a namespace is that when we use a name from the library, we must say explicitly that we want to use the name from the std namespace. Writing std::cout uses the scope operator (the :: 
operator) to say that we want to use the name cout that is defined in the namespace std. ¬ß 3.1 
(p. 82) will show a simpler way to access names from the library. 

Reading from a Stream 
Having asked the user for input, we next want to read that input. We start by defining two variables 
named v1 and v2 to hold the input: 
int v1 = 0, v2 =0; 
We define these variables as type int, which is a built-in type representing integers. We also initialize 
them to 0. When we initialize a variable, we give it the indicated value at the same time as the variable is created. 
The next statement 
std::cin >> v1 >> v2; 
reads the input. The input operator (the . operator) behaves analogously to the output operator. It takes an istream as its left-hand operand and an object as its right-hand operand. It reads data from the given istream and stores what was read in the given object. Like the output operator, the input operator returns its left-hand operand as its result. Hence, this expression is equivalent to 
(std::cin >> v1) >> v2; 
Because the operator returns its left-hand operand, we can combine a sequence of input requests into a single statement. Our input operation reads two values from std::cin, storing the first in v1 and the second in v2. In other words, our input operation executes as 
std::cin >> v1; 
std::cin >> v2; 

Completing the Program 
What remains is to print our result: 
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1 << " and " << v2 << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl; 
This statement, although longer than the one that prompted the user for input, is conceptually similar. It prints each of its operands on the standard output. What is interesting in this example is that the operands are not all the same kinds of values. Some operands are string literals, such as "The sum of ". 
Others are int values, such as v1, v2, and the result of evaluating the arithmetic expression v1 + v2. The library defines versions of the input and output operators that handle operands of each of these differing types. 

Exercises Section 1.2 
Exercise 1.3: Write a program to print Hello, World on the standard output. 
Exercise 1.4: Our program used the addition operator, +, to add two numbers. Write a program that uses the multiplication operator, *, to print the product instead. 
Exercise 1.5: We wrote the output in one large statement. Rewrite the program to use a separate statement to print each operand. 
Exercise 1.6: Explain whether the following program fragment is legal. 
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1; 
<< " and " << v2; 
<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl; 
If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it? 

### 1.3. A Word about Comments 

Before our programs get much more complicated, we should see how C++ handles comments. Comments help the human readers of our programs. They are typically used to summarize an algorithm, identify the purpose of a variable, or clarify an otherwise obscure segment of code. The compiler ignores comments, so they have no effect on the program's behavior or performance. 
Although the compiler ignores comments, readers of our code do not. Programmers tend to believe comments even when other parts of the system documentation are out of date. An incorrect comment is worse than no comment at all because it may mislead the reader. When you change your code, be sure to update the comments, too! 
Kinds of Comments in C++ 
There are two kinds of comments in C++: single-line and paired. A single-line comment starts with a double slash (//) and ends with a newline. Everything to the right of the slashes on the current line is ignored by the compiler. A comment of this kind can contain any text, including additional double slashes. 
The other kind of comment uses two delimiters (/* and */) that are inherited from C. Such comments begin with a /* and end with the next */. These comments can include anything that is not a */, including newlines. The compiler treats everything that falls between the /* and */ as part of the comment. 
A comment pair can be placed anywhere a tab, space, or newline is permitted. Comment pairs can span multiple lines of a program but are not required to do so. When a comment pair does span multiple lines, it is often a good idea to indicate visually that the inner lines are part of a multiline comment. Our style is to begin each line in the comment with an asterisk, thus indicating that the entire range is part of a multiline comment. 
Programs typically contain a mixture of both comment forms. Comment pairs generally are used for multiline explanations, whereas double-slash comments tend to be used for half-line and single-line remarks: 

`# include <iostream>` 

* 
Simple main function: 

* 
Read two numbers and write their sum 

*/ int main() { 
// prompt user to enter two numbers std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl; int v1 =0, v2 =0; // variables to hold the input we read std::cin >> v1 >> v2; // read input std::cout << "The sum of " << v1 << " and " << v2 
<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl; return 0; } 


Note 
In this book, we italicize comments to make them stand out from the normal program text. In actual programs, whether comment text is distinguished from the text used for program code depends on the sophistication of the programming environment you are using. 

Comment Pairs Do Not Nest 
A comment that begins with /* ends with the next */. As a 
result, one comment pair cannot appear inside another. The compiler error messages that result from this kind of mistake can be mysterious and confusing. As an example, compile the following program on your system: 
/* 
* 
comment pairs /* */ cannot nest. 

* 
''cannot nest'' is considered source code, 

* 
as is the rest of the program 


*/ int main() { 
return 0; } 
We often need to comment out a block of code during debugging. Because that code might contain nested comment pairs, the best way to comment a block of code is to insert single-line comments at the beginning of each line in the section we want to ignore: 
// /* 
// * everything inside a single-line comment is ignored 
// * including nested comment pairs 
// */ 

Exercises Section 1.3 
Exercise 1.7: Compile a program that has incorrectly 
nested comments. 
Exercise 1.8: Indicate which, if any, of the following output 
statements are legal: 
std::cout << "/*"; std::cout << "*/"; std::cout << /* "*/" */; std::cout << /* "*/" /* "/*" */; 
After you've predicted what will happen, test your answers by compiling a program with each of these statements. Correct any errors you encounter. 


1.4. Flow of Control 
Statements normally execute sequentially: The first statement in a block is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. Of course, few programs'including the one to solve our bookstore problem'can be written using only sequential execution. Instead, programming languages provide various flow-of-control statements that allow for more complicated execution paths. 
1.4.1. The while Statement 
A while 
statement 
repeatedly executes a section of code so long as a given condition is true. We can use a while to write a program to sum the numbers from 1 through 10 inclusive as follows: 
#include <iostream> int main() { 
int sum =0, val =1; // keep executing the while as long as val is less than or equal to 10 
while (val <= 10) { 
sum += val; // assigns sum + val to sum 
++val; // add 1 to val 
} std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is " << sum << std::endl; return 0; } 
When we compile and execute this program, it prints 

Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is 55 
As before, we start by including the iostream header and defining main. Inside main we define two int variables: sum, which will hold our summation, and val, which will represent each of the values from 1 through 10. We give sum an initial value of 0 and start val off with the value 1. 
The new part of this program is the while statement. A while has the form 
while (condition) statement 
A while executes by (alternately) testing the condition and executing the associated statement until the condition is false. A condition 
is an expression that yields a result that is either true or false. So long as condition is true, statement is executed. After executing statement, condition is tested again. If condition is again true, then statement is again executed. The while continues, alternately testing the condition and executing statement until the condition is false. 
In this program, the while statement is 
// keep executing the while as long as val is less than or equal to 10 
while (val <= 10) { 
sum += val; // assigns sum + val to sum 
++val; // add 1 to val 
} 
The 
condition 
uses 
the 
less-than-or-equal 
operator 
(the 
<= 
operator) 
to 
compare 
the 
current 
value 
of 
val 
and 
10. 
As 
long as val is less than or equal to 10, the condition is true. If the condition is true, we execute the body of the while. In this case, that body is a block with two statements: 
{ sum += val; // assigns sum + val to sum ++val; // add 1 to val } 
A block is a sequence of zero or more statements enclosed by curly braces. A block is a statement and may be used wherever a statement is required. The first statement in this block uses the compound assignment operator (the += 
operator). This operator adds its right-hand operand to its left-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand. It has essentially the same effect as writing an addition and an assignment: 
sum =sum + val; // assign sum + val to sum Thus, the first statement in the block adds the value of val to the current value of sum and stores the result back into sum. The next statement 
++val; // add 1to val 
uses the prefix increment operator (the ++ 
operator). The increment operator adds 1 to its operand. Writing ++val is the same as writing val = val + 1. 
After executing the while body, the loop evaluates the condition again. If the (now incremented) value of val is still less than or equal to 10, then the body of the while is executed again. The loop continues, testing the condition and executing the body, until val is no longer less than or equal to 10. 
Once val is greater than 10, the program falls out of the while loop and continues execution with the statement following the while. In this case, that statement prints our output, followed by the return, which completes our main program. 

Exercises Section 1.4.1 
Exercise 1.9: Write a program that uses a while to sum the numbers from 50 to 100. Exercise 1.10: In addition to the ++ operator that adds 1 to 
its operand, there is a decrement operator (--) that subtracts 1. Use the decrement operator to write a while that prints the numbers from ten down to zero. 
Exercise 1.11: Write a program that prompts the user for two integers. Print each number in the range specified by those two integers. 

1.4.2. The for Statement 
In our while loop we used the variable val to control how many times we executed the loop. We tested the value of val in the condition and incremented val in the while body. 
This pattern'using a variable in a condition and incrementing that variable in the body'happens so often that the language defines a second statement, the for 
statement, that abbreviates code that follows this pattern. We can rewrite this program using a for loop to sum the numbers from 1 through 10 as follows: 
#include <iostream> 
int main() 
{ 
int sum = 0; 
// sum values from 1 through 10 inclusive 
for (int val = 1; val <= 10; ++val) sum += val; // equivalent to sum = sum + val std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is " << sum << std::endl; return 0; } 
As before, we define sum and initialize it to zero. In this version, we define val as part of the for statement itself: 
for (int val = 1; val <= 10; ++val) sum += val; 
Each for statement has two parts: a header and a body. The header controls how often the body is executed. The header itself consists of three parts: an init-statement,a condition, and an expression. In this case, the init-statement 
int val = 1; 
defines an int object named val and gives it an initial value of 1. The variable val exists only inside the for; it is not possible to use val after this loop terminates. The init-statement is executed only once, on entry to the for. The condition 
val <= 10 compares the current value in val to 10. The condition is tested each time through the loop. As long as val is less than or equal to 10, we execute the for body. The expression is executed after the for body. Here, the expression 
++val uses the prefix increment operator, which adds 1 to the value of val. After executing the expression, the for retests the condition. If the new value of val is still less than or equal to 10, then the for loop body is executed again. After executing the body, val is incremented again. The loop continues until the condition fails. 
In this loop, the for body performs the summation 
sum += val; // equivalent to sum = sum + val To recap, the overall execution flow of this for is: 
1. 
Create val and initialize it to 1. 

2. 
Test whether val is less than or equal to 10. If the test succeeds, execute the for body. If the test fails, exit the loop and continue execution with the first statement following the for body. 

3. 
Increment val. 

4. 
Repeat the test in step 2, continuing with the remaining steps as long as the condition is true. 


Exercises Section 1.4.2 Exercise 1.12: What does the following for loop do? What is the final value of sum? 
int sum = 0; for (int i = -100; i <= 100; ++i) sum += i; 
Exercise 1.13: Rewrite the exercises from ¬ß 1.4.1 
(p. 
13) using for loops. 
Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form? 
Exercise 1.15: Write programs that contain the common errors discussed in the box on page 16. Familiarize yourself with the messages the compiler generates. 

1.4.3. Reading an Unknown Number of Inputs 
In the preceding sections, we wrote programs that summed the numbers from 1 through 10. A logical extension of this program would be to ask the user to input a set of numbers to sum. In this case, we won't know how many numbers to add. Instead, we'll keep reading numbers until there are no more numbers to read: 
#include <iostream> int main() { 
int sum = 0, value = 0; // read until end-of-file, calculating a running total of all values read while (std::cin >> value) 
sum += value; // equivalent to sum = sum + value 
std::cout << "Sum is: " << sum << std::endl; return 0; } 
If we give this program the input 
3456 
then our output will be 

Sum is: 18 
The first line inside main defines two int variables, named sum and value, which we initialize to 0. We'll use value to hold each number as we read it from the input. We read the data inside the condition of the while: 
while (std::cin >> value) Evaluating the while condition executes the expression 
std::cin >> value 
That expression reads the next number from the standard input and stores that number in value. The input operator (¬ß 1.2, p. 
8) returns its left operand, which in this case is std::cin. This condition, therefore, tests std::cin. 
When we use an istream as a condition, the effect is to test the state of the stream. If the stream is valid'that is, if the stream hasn't encountered an error'then the test succeeds. An istream becomes invalid when we hit end-of-file 
or encounter an invalid input, such as reading a value that is not an integer. An istream that is in an invalid state will cause the condition to yield false. 
Thus, our while executes until we encounter end-of-file (or an input error). The while body uses the compound assignment operator to add the current value to the evolving sum. Once the condition fails, the while ends. We fall through and execute the next statement, which prints the sum followed by endl. 

Entering an End-of-File from the Keyboard 
When we enter input to a program from the keyboard, different operating systems use different conventions to allow us to indicate end-of-file. On Windows systems we enter an end-of-file by typing a control-z'hold down the Ctrl key and press z'followed by hitting either the Enter or Return key. On UNIX systems, including on Mac OS X machines, end-of-file is usually control-d. 
Compilation Revisited Part of the compiler's job is to look for errors in the program text. A compiler cannot detect whether a program does what its author intends, but it can detect errors in the form 
of the program. The following are the most common kinds of errors a compiler will detect. Syntax errors: The programmer has made a grammatical 
error in the C++ language. The following program illustrates common syntax errors; each comment describes the error on the following line: 
// error: missing ) in parameter list for main 
int main ( { // error: used colon, not a semicolon, after endl std::cout << "Read each file." << std::endl: // error: missing quotes around string literal std::cout << Update master. << std::endl; // error: second output operator is missing std::cout << "Write new master." std::endl; // error: missing ; on return statement return 0 
} Type errors: Each item of data in C++ has an associated type. The value 10, for example, has a type of int (or, more colloquially, 'is an int'). The word "hello", including the double quotation marks, is a string literal. One example of a 
type error is passing a string literal to a function that expects an int argument. Declaration errors: Every name used in a C++ program 
must be declared before it is used. Failure to declare a name usually results in an error message. The two most common declaration errors are forgetting to use std:: for a name from the library and misspelling the name of an identifier: 
#include <iostream> int main() { 
int v1 = 0, v2 = 0; 
std::cin >> v >> v2; // error: uses "v" not "v1" // error: cout not defined; should be std::cout cout << v1 + v2 << std::endl; return 0; 
} 
Error messages usually contain a line number and a brief description of what the compiler believes we have done wrong. It is a good practice to correct errors in the sequence they are reported. Often a single error can have a cascading effect and cause a compiler to report more errors than actually are present. It is also a good idea to recompile the code after each fix'or after making at most a small number 
of 
obvious 
fixes. 
This 
cycle 
is 
known 
as 
edit-compile-debug. 

Exercises Section 1.4.3 Exercise 1.16: Write your own version of a program that prints the sum of a set of integers read from cin. 

1.4.4. The if Statement 
Like most languages, C++ provides an if 
statement 
that supports conditional execution. We can use an if to write a program to count how many consecutive times each distinct value appears in the input: 
#include <iostream> int main() { 
// currVal is the number we're counting; we'll read new values into val 
int currVal = 0, val = 0; // read first number and ensure that we have data to process if (std::cin >> currVal) { 
int cnt =1; // store the count for the current value we're processing while (std::cin >> val) { // read the remaining numbers if (val == currVal) // if the values are the same ++cnt; // add 1 to cnt else { // otherwise, print the count for the previous value std::cout << currVal << " occurs " 
<< cnt << " times" << std::endl; currVal = val; // remember the new value cnt =1; // reset the counter 
} } // while loop ends here // remember to print the count for the last value in the file std::cout << currVal << " occurs " 
<< cnt << " times" << std::endl; } // outermost if statement ends here return 0; 
} 
If we give this program the following input: 
42 42 42 42 42 55 55 62 100 100 100 
then the output should be 
42 occurs 5 times 55 occurs 2 times 62 occurs 1 times 100 occurs 3 times 
Much of the code in this program should be familiar from our earlier programs. We start by defining val and currVal: currVal will keep track of which number we are counting; val will hold each number as we read it from the input. What's new are the two if statements. The first if 
if (std::cin >> currVal) { // ... } // outermost if statement ends here 
ensures that the input is not empty. Like a while, an if evaluates a condition. The condition in the first if reads a value into currVal. If the read succeeds, then the condition is true and we execute the block that starts with the open curly following the condition. That block ends with the close curly just before the return statement. 
Once we know there are numbers to count, we define cnt, which will count how often each distinct number occurs. We use a while loop similar to the one in the previous section to (repeatedly) read numbers from the standard input. 
The body of the while is a block that contains the second if statement: 
if (val == currVal) // if the values are the same ++cnt; // add 1to cnt else { // otherwise, print the count for the previous value std::cout << currVal << " occurs " 
<< cnt << " times" << std::endl; 
currVal = val; // remember the new value 
cnt =1; // reset the counter 
} 
The 
condition 
in 
this 
if 
uses 
the 
equality 
operator 

(the 

operator) 
to 
test 
whether 
val 
is 
equal 
to 
currVal. 
If 
so, 
we execute the statement that immediately follows the condition. That statement increments cnt, indicating that we have seen currVal once more. 
If the condition is false'that is, if val is not equal to currVal' then we execute the statement following the else. This statement is a block consisting of an output statement and two assignments. The output statement prints the count for the value we just finished processing. The assignments reset cnt to 1 and currVal to val, which is the number we just read. 


Warning 
C++ uses = for assignment and == for equality. Both operators can appear inside a condition. It is a common mistake to write = when you mean == inside a condition. 

Exercises Section 1.4.4 Exercise 1.17: What happens in the program 
presented in this section if the input values are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values? Exercise 1.18: Compile and run the program from this 
section giving it only equal values as input. Run it again 
giving it values in which no number is repeated. Exercise 1.19: Revise the program you wrote for the exercises in ¬ß 1.4.1 
(p. 13) that printed a range of numbers so that it handles input in which the first number is smaller than the second. 
Key Concept: Indentation and Formatting of C++ Programs C++ programs are largely free-format, meaning that where we put curly braces, indentation, comments, and newlines usually has no effect on what our programs mean. For example, the curly brace that denotes the beginning of the body of main could be on the same line as main; positioned as we have done, at the beginning of the next line; or 
placed anywhere else we'd like. The only requirement is that the open curly must be the first nonblank, noncomment character following main's parameter list. 
Although we are largely free to format programs as we wish, the choices we make affect the readability of our programs. We could, for example, have written main on a single long line. Such a definition, although legal, would be hard to read. 
Endless debates occur as to the right way to format C or C++ programs. Our belief is that there is no single correct style but that there is value in consistency. Most programmers indent subsidiary parts of their programs, as we've done with the statements inside main and the bodies of our loops. We tend to put the curly braces that delimit functions on their own lines. We also indent compound IO expressions so that the operators line up. Other indentation conventions will become clear as our programs become more sophisticated. 
The important thing to keep in mind is that other ways to format programs are possible. When you choose a formatting style, think about how it affects readability and comprehension. Once you've chosen a style, use it consistently. 


1.5. Introducing Classes 
The only remaining feature we need to understand before solving 
our 
bookstore 
problem 
is 
how 
to 
define 
a 
data 
structure 
to 
represent 
our 
transaction 
data. 
In 
C++ 
we define our own data structures by defining a class. A class defines a type along with a collection of operations that are related to that type. The class mechanism is one of the most important features in C++. In fact, a primary focus of the design of C++ is to make it possible to define class 
types 
that behave as naturally as the built-in types. 
In this section, we'll describe a simple class that we can use in writing our bookstore program. We'll implement this class in later chapters as we learn more about types, expressions, statements, and functions. 
To use a class we need to know three things: 
. 
What is its name? 

. 
Where is it defined? 


. What operations does it support? For our bookstore problem, we'll assume that the class is named Sales_item and that it is already defined in a header named Sales_item.h. 
As we've seen, to use a library facility, we must include the associated header. Similarly, we use headers to access classes defined for our own applications. Conventionally, header file names are derived from the name of a class defined in that header. Header files that we write usually have a suffix of .h, but some programmers use .H, .hpp, or .hxx. The standard library headers typically have no suffix at all. Compilers usually don't care about the form of header file names, but IDEs sometimes do. 
1.5.1. The Sales_item Class 
The purpose of the Sales_item class is to represent the total revenue, number of copies sold, and average sales price for a book. How these data are stored or computed is not our concern. To use a class, we need not care about how it is implemented. Instead, what we need to know is what operations objects of that type can perform. 
Every class defines a type. The type name is the same as the name of the class. Hence, our Sales_item class defines a type named Sales_item. As with the built-in types, we can define a variable of a class type. When we write 
Sales_item item; we are saying that item is an object of type Sales_item. We often contract the phrase 'an object of type Sales_item' to 'a Sales_item object' or even more simply to 'a Sales_item.¬ß 
In addition to being able to define variables of type Sales_item, we can: 
. 
Call a function named isbn to fetch the ISBN from a Sales_item object. 

. 
Use the input (>>) and output (<<) operators to read and write objects of type Sales_item. 

. 
Use the assignment operator (=) to assign one Sales_item object to another. 

. 
Use the addition operator (+) to add two Sales_item objects. The two objects must refer to the same ISBN. The result is a new Sales_item object whose ISBN is that of its operands and whose number sold and revenue are the sum of the corresponding values in its operands. 

. 
Use the compound assignment operator (+=) to add one Sales_item object into another. 



Key Concept: Classes Define Behavior 
The important thing to keep in mind when you read these programs is that the author of the Sales_item class defines all the actions that can be performed by objects of this class. That is, the Sales_item class defines what happens when a Sales_item object is created and what happens when the assignment, addition, or the input and output operators are applied to Sales_items. 
In general, the class author determines all the operations that can be used on objects of the class type. For now, the only operations we know we can perform on Sales_item objects are the ones listed in this section. 
Reading and Writing Sales_items 
Now that we know what operations we can use with Sales_item objects, we can write programs that use the class. For example, the following program reads data from the standard input into a Sales_item object and writes that Sales_item back onto the standard output: 
#include <iostream> #include "Sales_item.h" int main() { 
Sales_item book; // read ISBN, number of copies sold, and sales price std::cin >> book; 
// write ISBN, number of copies sold, total revenue, and average price 
std::cout << book << std::endl; return 0; } 
If the input to this program is 
0-201-70353-X 4 24.99 
then the output will be 


0-201-70353-X 4 99.96 24.99 
Our input says that we sold four copies of the book at $24.99 each, and the output indicates that the total sold was four, the total revenue was $99.96, and the average price per book was $24.99. 
This program starts with two #include directives, one of which uses a new form. Headers from the standard library are enclosed in angle brackets (<>). Those that are not part of the library are enclosed in double quotes (""). 
Inside main we define an object, named book, that we'll use to hold the data that we read from the standard input. The next statement reads into that object, and the third statement prints it to the standard output followed by printing endl. 
Adding Sales_items 
A more interesting example adds two Sales_item objects: 
#include <iostream> 
#include "Sales_item.h" 
int main() 
{ 
Sales_item item1, item2; 
std::cin >> item1 >> item2; // read a pair of transactions 
std::cout << item1 + item2 << std::endl; // print their sum 
return 0; 
} 
If we give this program the following input 
0-201-78345-X 3 20.00 
0-201-78345-X 2 25.00 
our output is 
0-201-78345-X 5 110 22 
This program starts by including the Sales_item and iostream headers. Next we define two Sales_item objects to hold the transactions. We read data into these objects from the standard input. The output expression does the addition and prints the result. 
It's worth noting how similar this program looks to the one on page 6: We read two inputs and write their sum. What makes this similarity noteworthy is that instead of reading and printing the sum of two integers, we're reading and printing the sum of two Sales_item objects. Moreover, the whole idea of 'sum' is different. In the case of ints we are generating a conventional sum'the result of adding two numeric values. In the case of Sales_item objects we use a conceptually new meaning for sum 'the result of adding the components of two Sales_item objects. 


Using File Redirection 
It can be tedious to repeatedly type these transactions as input to the programs you are testing. Most operating systems support file redirection, which lets us associate a named file with the standard input and the standard output: 
$ addItems <infile >outfile Assuming $ is the system prompt and our addition program has been compiled into an executable file named addItems.exe (or addItems on UNIX systems), this command will read transactions from a file named infile and write its output to a file named outfile in the current directory. 

Exercises Section 1.5.1 Exercise 1.20: 
http://www.informit.com/title/032174113 
contains a copy of Sales_item.h in the Chapter 
1 
code directory. Copy that file to your working directory. Use it to write a program that reads a set of book sales transactions, writing each transaction to the standard output. 
Exercise 1.21: Write a program that reads two Sales_item objects that have the same ISBN and produces 
their sum. Exercise 1.22: Write a program that reads several transactions for the same ISBN. Write the sum of all the transactions that were read. 

1.5.2. A First Look at Member Functions 
Our program that adds two Sales_items should check whether the objects have the same ISBN. We'll do so as follows: 
#include <iostream> #include "Sales_item.h" int main() { 
Sales_item item1, item2; std::cin >> item1 >> item2; // first check that item1 and item2 represent the same book 
if (item1.isbn() == item2.isbn()) { 
std::cout << item1 + item2 << std::endl; 
return 0; // indicate success 
} else { std::cerr << "Data must refer to same ISBN" << std::endl; return -1; // indicate failure } } 
The difference between this program and the previous version is the if and its associated else branch. Even without understanding the if condition, we know what this program does. If the condition succeeds, then we write the same output as before and return 0, indicating success. If the condition fails, we execute the block following the else, which prints a message and returns an error indicator. 
What Is a Member Function? 
The if condition 
item1.isbn() == item2.isbn() calls a member 
function 
named isbn. A member function is a function that is defined as part of a class. Member functions are sometimes referred to as methods. 
Ordinarily, we call a member function on behalf of an object. For example, the first part of the left-hand operand of the equality expression 
item1.isbn 
uses the dot operator (the ¬ß.¬ß operator) to say that we want 'the isbn member of the object named item1.¬ß The dot operator applies only to objects of class type. The left-hand operand must be an object of class type, and the right-hand operand must name a member of that type. The result of the dot operator is the member named by the right-hand operand. 
When we use the dot operator to access a member function, we usually do so to call that function. We call a function using the call operator (the () 
operator). The call operator is a pair of parentheses that enclose a (possibly empty) list of arguments. The isbn member function does not take an argument. Thus, 
item1.isbn() calls the isbn function that is a member of the object named item1. This function returns the ISBN stored in item1. 
The right-hand operand of the equality operator executes in the same way'it returns the ISBN stored in item2. If the ISBNs are the same, the condition is true; otherwise it is false. 
Exercises Section 1.5.2 Exercise 1.23: Write a program that reads several transactions and counts how many transactions occur 
for each ISBN. Exercise 1.24: Test the previous program by giving multiple transactions representing multiple ISBNs. The records for each ISBN should be grouped together. 

### 1.6. The Bookstore Program 

We are now ready to solve our original bookstore problem. We need to read a file of sales transactions and produce a report that shows, for each book, the total number of copies sold, the total revenue, and the average sales price. We'll assume that all the transactions for each ISBN are grouped together in the input. 
Our program will combine the data for each ISBN in a variable named total. We'll use a second variable named trans to hold each transaction we read. If trans and total refer to the same ISBN, we'll update total. Otherwise we'll print total and reset it using the transaction we just read: 
#include <iostream> #include "Sales_item.h" int main() { 
Sales_item total; // variable to hold data for the next transaction 
// read the first transaction and ensure that there are data to process 
if (std::cin >> total) { 
Sales_item trans; // variable to hold the running sum 
// read and process the remaining transactions 
while (std::cin >> trans) { 
// if we're still processing the same book 
if (total.isbn() == trans.isbn()) 
total += trans; // update the running total 
else { 
// print results for the previous book 
std::cout << total << std::endl; 
total = trans; // total now refers to the next book 
} } std::cout << total << std::endl; // print the last transaction 
} else { // no input! warn the user 
std::cerr << "No data?!" << std::endl; 
return -1; // indicate failure 
} 
return 0; 
} 
This program is the most complicated one we've seen so far, but it uses only facilities that we have already seen. 
As usual, we begin by including the headers that we use, iostream from the library and our own Sales_item.h. Inside main we define an object named total, which we'll use to sum the data for a given ISBN. We start by reading the first transaction into total and testing whether the read was successful. If the read fails, then there are no records and we fall through to the outermost else branch, which tells the user that there was no input. 
Assuming we have successfully read a record, we execute the block following the outermost if. That block starts by defining the object named trans, which will hold our transactions as we read them. The while statement will read all the remaining records. As in our earlier programs, the while condition reads a value from the standard input. In this case, we read a Sales_item object into trans. As long as the read succeeds, we execute the body of the while. 
The body of the while is a single if statement. The if checks whether the ISBNs are equal. If so, we use the compound assignment operator to add trans to total. If the ISBNs are not equal, we print the value stored in total and reset total by assigning trans to it. After executing the if, we return to the condition in the while, reading the next transaction, and so on until we run out of records.

Chapter Summary 
This chapter introduced enough of C++ to let you compile and execute simple C++ programs. We saw how to define a main function, which is the function that the operating system calls to execute our program. We also saw how to define variables, how to do input and output, and how to write if, for, and while statements. The chapter closed by introducing the most fundamental facility in C++: the class. In this chapter, we saw how to create and use objects of a class that someone else has defined. Later chapters will show how to define our own classes. 

Defined Terms 
argument 
Value passed to a function. 
assignment 
Obliterates an object's current value and replaces that value by a new one. 
block 
Sequence of zero or more statements enclosed in curly braces. 
buffer 
A region of storage used to hold data. IO facilities often store input (or output) in a buffer and read or write the buffer independently from actions in the program. Output buffers can be explicitly flushed to force the buffer to be written. By default, reading cin flushes cout; cout is also flushed when the program ends normally. 
built-in 
type 
Type, such as int, defined by the language. 
cerr 
ostream object tied to the standard error, which often writes to the same device as the standard output. By default, writes to cerr are not buffered. Usually used for error messages or other output that is not part of the normal logic of the program. 
character string literal Another term for string literal. 
cin 
istream object used to read from the standard input. 
class 
Facility for defining our own data structures together with associated operations. The class is one of the most fundamental features in C++. Library types, such as istream and ostream, are classes. 
class 
type 
A type defined by a class. The name of the type is the class name. 
clog 
ostream object tied to the standard error. By default, writes to clog are buffered. Usually used to report 
information about program execution to a log file. 
comments 
Program text that is ignored by the compiler. C++ has two kinds of comments: single-line and paired. Single-line comments start with a //. Everything from the // to the end of the line is a comment. Paired comments begin with a /* and include all text up to the next */. 
condition 
An expression that is evaluated as true or false. A value of zero is false; any other value yields true. 
cout 
ostream object used to write to the standard output. Ordinarily used to write the output of a program. 
curly 
brace 
Curly braces delimit blocks. An open curly ({) starts a block; a close curly (}) ends one. 
data 
structure 
A logical grouping of data and operations on that data. 
edit-compile-debug 
The process of getting a program to execute properly. 
end-of-file 
System-specific marker that indicates that there is no more input in a file. 
expression 
The smallest unit of computation. An expression consists of one or more operands and usually one or more operators. Expressions are evaluated to produce a result. For example, assuming i and j are ints, then i+j is an expression and yields the sum of the two int values. 
for 
statement 
Iteration statement that provides iterative execution. Often used to repeat a calculation a fixed number of times. 
function 
Named unit of computation. 
function 
body 
Block that defines the actions performed by a function. 
function 
name 
Name by which a function is known and can be called. 
header 
Mechanism whereby the definitions of a class or other names are made available to multiple programs. A program uses a header through a #include directive. 
if 
statement 
Conditional execution based on the value of a specified condition. If the condition is true, the if body is executed. If not, the else body is executed if there is one. 
initialize 
Give an object a value at the same time that it is created. 
iostream 
Header that provides the library types for stream-oriented input and output. 
istream 
Library type providing stream-oriented input. 
library type Type, such as istream, defined by the standard library. 
main 
Function called by the operating system to execute a C++ program. Each program must have one and only one function named main. 
manipulator 
Object, such as std::endl, that when read or written 'manipulates' the stream itself. 
member 
function 
Operation defined by a class. Member functions ordinarily are called to operate on a specific object. 
method 
Synonym for member function. 
namespace 
Mechanism for putting names defined by a library into a single place. Namespaces help avoid inadvertent name clashes. The names defined by the C++ library are in the namespace std. 
ostream 
Library type providing stream-oriented output. 
parameter 
list 
Part of the definition of a function. Possibly empty list that specifies what arguments can be used to call the function. 
return 
type 
Type of the value returned by a function. 
source 
file 
Term used to describe a file that contains a C++ program. 
standard 
error 
Output stream used for error reporting. Ordinarily, the standard output and the standard error are tied to the window in which the program is executed. 
standard 
input 
Input stream usually associated with the window in which the program executes. 
standard 
library 
Collection of types and functions that every C++ compiler must support. The library provides the types that support IO. C++ programmers tend to talk about 'the library,¬ß meaning the entire standard library. They also tend to refer to particular parts of the library by referring to a library type, such as the 'iostream library,¬ß meaning the part of the standard library that defines the IO classes. 
standard 
output 
Output stream usually associated with the window in which the program executes. 
statement 
A part of a program that specifies an action to take place when the program is executed. An expression followed by a semicolon is a statement; other kinds of statements include blocks and if, for, and while statements, all of which contain other statements within themselves. 
std 
Name of the namespace used by the standard library. std::cout indicates that we're using the name cout defined in the std namespace. 
string 
literal 
Sequence of zero or more characters enclosed in double quotes ("a string literal"). 
uninitialized variable Variable that is not given an initial value. Variables of class type for which no initial value is specified are initialized as specified by the class definition. Variables of built-in type defined inside a function are uninitialized unless explicitly initialized. It is an error to try to use the value of an uninitialized variable. Uninitialized variables are a rich source of bugs. 
variable 
A named object. 
while 
statement 
Iteration statement that provides iterative execution so long as a specified condition is true. The body is executed zero or more times, depending on the truth value of the condition. 
() 
operator 
Call operator. A pair of parentheses ¬ß()¬ß following a function name. The operator causes a function to be invoked. Arguments to the function may be passed inside the parentheses. 
++ 
operator 
Increment operator. Adds 1 to the operand; ++i is equivalent to i=i+1. 
+= 
operator 
Compound assignment operator that adds the right-hand operand to the left and stores the result in the left-hand operand; a += b is equivalent to a=a+b. 
. operator Dot operator. Left-hand operand must be an object of class type and the right-hand operand must be the name of a member of that object. The operator yields the named member of the given object. 
:: 
operator 
Scope operator. Among other uses, the scope operator is used to access names in a namespace. For example, std::cout denotes the name cout from the namespace std. 
= operator Assigns the value of the right-hand operand to the object denoted by the left-hand operand. 
--operator Decrement operator. Subtracts 1 from the operand; --i is equivalent to i=i-1. 
<< operator Output operator. Writes the right-hand operand to the output stream indicated by the left-hand operand: cout << "hi" writes hi to the standard output. Output operations can be chained together: cout << "hi" << "bye" writes hibye. 
>> operator Input operator. Reads from the input stream specified by the left-hand operand into the right-hand operand: cin >> i reads the next value on the standard input into i. Input operations can be chained together: cin >> i >> j reads first into i and then into j. 
`# include` Directive that makes code in a header available to a program. 
== 
operator 
The equality operator. Tests whether the left-hand operand is equal to the right-hand operand. 
!= operator The inequality operator. Tests whether the left-hand operand is not equal to the right-hand operand. 
<= 
operator

# Part I: The Basics 

Every widely used programming language provides a common set of features, which differ in detail from one language to another. Understanding the details of how a language provides these features is the first step toward understanding the language. Among the most fundamental of these common features are 

* Built-in types such as integers, characters, and so forth
* Variables, which let us give names to the objects we use 
* Expressions and statements to manipulate values of these types 
* Control structures, such as if or while, that allow us to conditionally or repeatedly execute a set of actions 
* Functions that let us define callable units of computation 

Most programming languages supplement these basic features in two ways: They let programmers extend the language by defining their own types, and they provide library routines that define useful functions and types not otherwise built into the language. 
In C++, as in most programming languages, the type of an object determines what operations can be performed on it. Whether a particular expression is legal depends on the type of the objects in that expression. Some languages, such as Smalltalk and Python, check types at run time. In contrast, C++ is a statically typed language; type checking is done at compile time. As a consequence, the compiler must know the type of every name used in the program. 
C++ provides a set of built-in types, operators to manipulate those types, and a small set of statements for program flow control. These elements form an alphabet from which we can write large, complicated, real-world systems. At this basic level, C++ is a simple language. Its expressive power arises from its support for mechanisms that allow the programmer to define new data structures. Using these facilities, programmers can shape the language to their own purposes without the language designers having to anticipate the programmers' needs. 
Perhaps the most important feature in C++ is the class, which lets programmers define their own types. In C++ such types are sometimes called 'class types' to distinguish them from the types that are built into the language. Some languages let programmers define types that specify only what data make up the type. Others, like C++, allow programmers to define types that include operations as well as data. A major design goal of C++ is to let programmers define their own types that are as easy to use as the built-in types. The Standard C++ library uses these features to implement a rich library of class types and associated functions. 
The first step in mastering C++'learning the basics of the language and library'is the topic of Part 
I. Chapter 
2 
covers the built-in types and looks briefly at the mechanisms for defining our own new types. Chapter 
3 
introduces two of the most fundamental library types: string and vector. That chapter also covers arrays, which are a lower-level data structure built into C++ and many other languages. Chapters 
4 
through 6 
cover expressions, statements, and functions. This part concludes in Chapter 
7, which describes the basics of building our own class types. As we'll see, defining our own types brings together all that we've learned before, because writing a class entails using the facilities covered in Part 
I. 

## Chapter 2. Variables and Basic Types 

Types are fundamental to any program: They tell us what our data mean and what operations we can perform on those data. 

C++ has extensive support for types. The language defines several primitive types (characters, integers, floating-point numbers, etc.) and provides mechanisms that let us define our own data types. The library uses these mechanisms to define more complicated types such as variable-length character strings, vectors, and so on. This chapter covers the built-in types and begins our coverage of how C++ supports more complicated types.

Types determine the meaning of the data and operations in our programs. The meaning of even as simple a statement as

```C++
i = i + j;
```

depends on the types of `i` and `j`. If `i` and `j` are integers, this statement has the ordinary, arithmetic meaning of `+`. However, if `i` and `j` are Sales_item objects (¬ß 1.5.1, p. 20), this statement adds the components of these two objects. 

### 2.1. Primitive Built-in Types 

C++ defines a set of primitive types that include the arithmetic 
types 
and a special type named void. The arithmetic types represent characters, integers, boolean values, and floating-point numbers. The void type has no associated values and can be used in only a few circumstances, most commonly as the return type for functions that do not return a value. 

2.1.1. Arithmetic Types 

The 
arithmetic 
types 
are 
divided 
into 
two 
categories: 
integral 
types 
(which 
include 
character 
and 
boolean 
types) 
and 
floating-point types. 
The size of'that is, the number of bits in'the arithmetic types varies across machines. The standard guarantees minimum sizes as listed in Table 
2.1. However, compilers are allowed to use larger sizes for these types. Because the number of bits varies, the largest (or smallest) value that a type can represent also varies. 

The bool type represents the truth values true and false. 
There are several character types, most of which exist to support internationalization. The basic character type is char.A char is guaranteed to be big enough to hold numeric values corresponding to the characters in the machine's basic character set. That is, a char is the same size as a single machine byte. 
The remaining character types'wchar_t, char16_t, and char32_t 'are used for extended character sets. The wchar_t type is guaranteed to be large enough to hold any character in the machine's largest extended character set. The types char16_t and char32_t are intended for Unicode characters. (Unicode is a standard for representing characters used in essentially any natural language.) 
The remaining integral types represent integer values of (potentially) different sizes. The language guarantees that an int will be at least as large as short,a long at least as large as an int, and long long at least as large as long. The type long long was introduced by the new standard. 


Machine-Level Representation of the Built-in Types 
Computers store data as a sequence of bits, each holding a 0 or 1, such as 
00011011011100010110010000111011 ... 
Most computers deal with memory as chunks of bits of sizes that are powers of 2. The smallest chunk of addressable memory is referred to as a 'byte.¬ß The basic unit of storage, usually a small number of bytes, is referred to as a 'word.¬ß In C++ a byte has at least as many bits as are needed to hold a character in the machine's basic character set. On most machines a byte contains 8 bits and a word is either 32 or 64 bits, that is, 4 or 8 bytes. 
Most computers associate a number (called an 'address') with each byte in memory. On a machine with 8-bit bytes and 32-bit words, we might view a word of memory as follows 

Here, the byte's address is on the left, with the 8 bits of the byte following the address. 
We can use an address to refer to any of several variously sized collections of bits starting at that address. It is possible to speak of the word at address 736424 or the byte at address 736427. To give meaning to memory at a given address, we must know the type of the value stored there. The type determines how many bits are used and how to interpret those bits. 
If the object at location 736424 has type float and if floats on this machine are stored in 32 bits, then we know that the object at that address spans the entire word. The value of that float depends on the details of how the machine stores floating-point numbers. Alternatively, if the object at location 736424 is an unsigned char on a machine using the ISO-Latin-1 character set, then the byte at that address represents a semicolon. 
The floating-point types represent single-, double-, and extended-precision values. The standard specifies a minimum number of significant digits. Most compilers provide more precision than the specified minimum. Typically, floats are represented in one word (32 bits), doubles in two words (64 bits), and long doubles in either three or four words (96 or 128 bits). The float and double types typically yield about 7 and 16 significant digits, respectively. The type long double is often used as a way to accommodate special-purpose floating-point hardware; its precision is more likely to vary from one implementation to another. 
Signed and Unsigned Types 
Except for bool and the extended character types, the integral types may be signed 
or unsigned. A signed type represents negative or positive numbers (including zero); an unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero. 
The types int, short, long, and long long are all signed. We obtain the corresponding unsigned type by adding unsigned to the type, such as unsigned long. The type unsigned int may be abbreviated as unsigned. 
Unlike the other integer types, there are three distinct basic character types: char, signed char, and unsigned char. In particular, char is not the same type as signed char. Although there are three character types, there are only two representations: signed and unsigned. The (plain) char type uses one of these representations. Which of the other two character representations is equivalent to char depends on the compiler. 
In an unsigned type, all the bits represent the value. For example, an 8-bit unsigned char can hold the values from 0 through 255 inclusive. 
The standard does not define how signed types are represented, but does specify that the range should be evenly divided between positive and negative values. Hence, an 8-bit signed char is guaranteed to be able to hold values from .127 through 127; most modern machines use representations that allow values from .128 through 127. 


Advice: Deciding which Type to Use 
C++, like C, is designed to let programs get close to the hardware when necessary. The arithmetic types are defined to cater to the peculiarities of various kinds of hardware. Accordingly, the number of arithmetic types in C++ can be bewildering. Most programmers can (and should) ignore these complexities by restricting the types they use. A few rules of thumb can be useful in deciding which type to use: 
. 
Use an unsigned type when you know that the values cannot be negative. 

. 
Use int for integer arithmetic. short is usually too small and, in practice, long often has the same size as int. If your data values are larger than the minimum guaranteed size of an int, then use long long. 

. 
Do not use plain char or bool in arithmetic expressions. Use them only to hold characters or truth values. Computations using char are especially problematic because char is signed on some machines and unsigned on others. If you need a tiny integer, explicitly specify either signed char or unsigned char. 

. 
Use double for floating-point computations; float usually does not have enough precision, and the cost of double-precision calculations versus single-precision is negligible. In fact, on some machines, double-precision operations are faster than single. The precision offered by long double usually is unnecessary and often entails considerable run-time cost. 



Exercises Section 2.1.1 Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, 
long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed 
type? Between a float and a double? Exercise 2.2: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type. 

2.1.2. Type Conversions 

The type of an object defines the data that an object might contain and what operations that object can perform. Among the operations that many types support is the ability to convert objects of the given type to other, related types. 
Type conversions happen automatically when we use an object of one type where an object of another type is expected. We'll have more to say about conversions in ¬ß 4.11 
(p. 159), but for now it is useful to understand what happens when we assign a value of one type to an object of another type. 
When we assign one arithmetic type to another: 
bool b=42; // b is trueint i=b; // i has value 1 i = 3.14; // i has value 3 double pi = i; // pi has value 3.0 unsigned char c = -1; // assuming 8-bit chars, c has value 255 signed char c2 = 256; // assuming 8-bit chars, the value of c2 is undefined 
what happens depends on the range of the values that the types permit: 
. 
When we assign one of the nonbool arithmetic types to a bool object, the result is false if the value is 0 and true otherwise. 

. 
When we assign a bool to one of the other arithmetic types, the resulting value is 1 if the bool is true and 0 if the bool is false. 

. 
When we assign a floating-point value to an object of integral type, the value is truncated. The value that is stored is the part before the decimal point. 

. 
When we assign an integral value to an object of floating-point type, the fractional part is zero. Precision may be lost if the integer has more bits than the floating-point object can accommodate. 

. 
If we assign an out-of-range value to an object of unsigned type, the result is the remainder of the value modulo the number of values the target type can hold. For example, an 8-bit unsigned char can hold values from 0 through 255, inclusive. If we assign a value outside this range, the compiler assigns the remainder of that value modulo 256. Therefore, assigning .1 to an 8-bit unsigned char gives that object the value 255. 

. 
If we assign an out-of-range value to an object of signed type, the result is undefined. The program might appear to work, it might crash, or it might produce garbage values. 


Advice: Avoid Undefined and Implementation-Defined 
Behavior Undefined behavior results from errors that the compiler is not required (and sometimes is not able) to detect. Even if the code compiles, a program that executes an undefined expression is in error. 
Unfortunately, programs that contain undefined behavior can appear to execute correctly in some circumstances and/or on some compilers. There is no guarantee that the same program, compiled under a different compiler or even a subsequent release of the same compiler, will continue to run correctly. Nor is there any guarantee that what works with one set of inputs will work with another. 
Similarly, programs usually should avoid implementation-defined behavior, such as assuming that the size of an int is a fixed and known value. Such programs are said to be nonportable. When the program is moved to another machine, code that relied on implementation-defined behavior may fail. Tracking down these sorts of problems in previously working programs is, mildly put, unpleasant. 
The compiler applies these same type conversions when we use a value of one arithmetic type where a value of another arithmetic type is expected. For example, when we use a nonbool value as a condition (¬ß 1.4.1, p. 12), the arithmetic value is converted to bool in the same way that it would be converted if we had assigned that arithmetic value to a bool variable: 
int i= 42; 
if (i) // condition will evaluate as true 
i = 0; 
If the value is 0, then the condition is false; all other (nonzero) values yield true. 
By the same token, when we use a bool in an arithmetic expression, its value always converts to either 0 or 1. As a result, using a bool in an arithmetic expression is almost surely incorrect. 
Expressions Involving Unsigned Types 

Although we are unlikely to intentionally assign a negative value to an object of unsigned type, we can (all too easily) write code that does so implicitly. For example, if we use both unsigned and int values in an arithmetic expression, the int value ordinarily is converted to unsigned. Converting an int to unsigned executes the same way as if we assigned the int to an unsigned: 
unsigned u = 10; 
int i= -42; 
std::cout << i + i << std::endl; // prints -84 
std::cout << u + i << std::endl; // if 32-bit ints, prints 4294967264 
In the first expression, we add two (negative) int values and obtain the expected result. In the second expression, the int value -42 is converted to unsigned before the addition is done. Converting a negative number to unsigned behaves exactly as if we had attempted to assign that negative value to an unsigned object. The value 'wraps around' as described above. 
Regardless of whether one or both operands are unsigned, if we subtract a value from an unsigned, we must be sure that the result cannot be negative: 
unsigned u1 = 42, u2 = 10; 
std::cout << u1 -u2 << std::endl; // ok: result is 32 std::cout << u2 -u1 << std::endl; // ok: but the result will wrap around 
The fact that an unsigned cannot be less than zero also affects how we write loops. For example, in the exercises to ¬ß 1.4.1 
(p. 13), you were to write a loop that used the decrement operator to print the numbers from 10 down to 0. The loop you wrote probably looked something like 
for (int i = 10; i >= 0; --i) std::cout << i << std::endl; 
We might think we could rewrite this loop using an unsigned. After all, we don't plan to print negative numbers. However, this simple change in type means that our loop will never terminate: 
// WRONG: u can never be less than 0; the condition will always succeed 
for (unsigned u = 10; u >= 0; --u) 
std::cout << u << std::endl; Consider what happens when u is 0. On that iteration, we'll print 0 and then execute the expression in the for loop. That expression, --u, subtracts 1 from u. That result, -1, won't fit in an unsigned value. As with any other out-of-range value, -1 will be transformed to an unsigned value. Assuming 32-bit ints, the result of --u, when u is 0, is 4294967295. 
One way to write this loop is to use a while instead of a for. Using a while lets us decrement before (rather than after) printing our value: 
unsigned u = 11; // start the loop one past the first element we want to 
print while (u > --u; 0  0)  {  / / d ecrement first, so that the last iteration will print  
std::cout  <<  u  <<  std::endl;  
}  

This loop starts by decrementing the value of the loop control variable. On the last iteration, u will be 1 on entry to the loop. We'll decrement that value, meaning that we'll print 0 on this iteration. When we next test u in the while condition, its value will be 0 and the loop will exit. Because we start by decrementing u, we have to initialize u to a value one greater than the first value we want to print. Hence, we initialize u to 11, so that the first value printed is 10. 


Caution: Don't Mix Signed and Unsigned Types 
Expressions that mix signed and unsigned values can yield surprising results when the signed value is negative. It is essential to remember that signed values are automatically converted to unsigned. For example, in an expression like a*b, if a is -1 and b is 1, then if both a and b are ints, the value is, as expected -1. However, if a is int and b is an unsigned, then the value of this expression depends on how many bits an int has on the particular machine. On our machine, this expression yields 4294967295. 

Exercises Section 2.1.2 
Exercise 2.3: What output will the following code produce? 
unsigned u = 10, u2 = 42; std::cout << u2 -u << std::endl; std::cout << u -u2 << std::endl; 
int i= 10, i2 =42; std::cout << i2 -i << std::endl; std::cout << i -i2 << std::endl; 
std::cout << i -u << std::endl; std::cout << u -i << std::endl; 
Exercise 2.4: Write a program to check whether your predictions were correct. If not, study this section until you understand what the problem is. 

2.1.3. Literals 
A value, such as 42, is known as a literal 
because its value self-evident. Every literal has a type. The form and value of a literal determine its type. 
Integer and Floating-Point Literals 
We can write an integer literal using decimal, octal, or hexadecimal notation. Integer literals that begin with 0 (zero) are interpreted as octal. Those that begin with either 0x or 0X are interpreted as hexadecimal. For example, we can write the value 20 in any of the following three ways: 
20 /* decimal */ 024 /* octal */ 0x14 /* hexadecimal */ 
The type of an integer literal depends on its value and notation. By default, decimal literals are signed whereas octal and hexadecimal literals can be either signed or unsigned types. A decimal literal has the smallest type of int, long, or long long (i.e., the first type in this list) in which the literal's value fits. Octal and hexadecimal literals have the smallest type of int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, or unsigned long long in which the literal's value fits. It is an error to use a literal that is too large to fit in the largest related type. There are no literals of type short. We'll see in Table 
2.2 
(p. 40) that we can override these defaults by using a suffix. 

Although integer literals may be stored in signed types, technically speaking, the value of a decimal literal is never a negative number. If we write what appears to be a negative decimal literal, for example, -42, the minus sign is not part of the literal. The minus sign is an operator that negates the value of its (literal) operand. 
Floating-point literals include either a decimal point or an exponent specified using scientific notation. Using scientific notation, the exponent is indicated by either E or e: 

3.14159 3.14159E0 0. 0e0 .001 
By default, floating-point literals have type double. We can override the default using a suffix from Table 
2.2 
(overleaf). 

Character and Character String Literals 
A character enclosed within single quotes is a literal of type char. Zero or more characters enclosed in double quotation marks is a string literal: 
'a' // character literal 
"Hello World!" // string literal 
The type of a string literal is array 
of constant chars, a type we'll discuss in ¬ß 3.5.4 
(p. 122). The compiler appends a null character (¬ß\0') to every string literal. Thus, the actual size of a string literal is one more than its apparent size. For example, the literal 'A' represents the single character A, whereas the string literal "A" represents an array of two characters, the letter A and the null character. 
Two string literals that appear adjacent to one another and that are separated only by spaces, tabs, or newlines are concatenated into a single literal. We use this form of literal when we need to write a literal that would otherwise be too large to fit comfortably on a single line: 
// multiline string literal std::cout << "a really, really long string literal " "that spans two lines" << std::endl;

Some characters, such as backspace or control characters, have no visible image. Such characters are nonprintable. Other characters (single and double quotation marks, question mark, and backslash) have special meaning in the language. Our programs cannot use any of these characters directly. Instead, we use an escape 
sequence 
to represent such characters. An escape sequence begins with a backslash. The language defines several escape sequences: 
newline  \n  horizontal  
tab  \t  alert (bel l)  \a  
vertical tab  \v  backspace  \b  double  
quote  \"  
backslash  \\  question ma rk  \?  single  
quote  \'  
carriage return  \r  formfeed  \f  

We use an escape sequence as if it were a single character: 
std::cout << '\n'; // prints a newline std::cout << "\tHi!\n"; // prints a tab followd by "Hi!" and a newline 
We can also write a generalized escape sequence, which is \x followed by one or more hexadecimal digits or a \ followed by one, two, or three octal digits. The value represents the numerical value of the character. Some examples (assuming the Latin-1 character set): 
\7 (bell) \12 (newline) \40 (blank) 
\0 (null) \115 ('M') \x4d ('M') 
As with an escape sequence defined by the language, we use these escape sequences as we would any other character: 
std::cout << "Hi \x4dO\115!\n"; // prints Hi MOM! followed by a newline std::cout << '\115' << '\n'; // prints M followed by a newline 
Note that if a \ is followed by more than three octal digits, only the first three are associated with the \. For example, "\1234" represents two characters: the character represented by the octal value 123 and the character 4. In contrast, \x uses up all the hex digits following it; "\x1234" represents a single, 16-bit character composed from the bits corresponding to these four hexadecimal digits. Because most machines have 8-bit chars, such values are unlikely to be useful. Ordinarily, hexadecimal characters with more than 8 bits are used with extended characters sets using one of the prefixes from Table 
2.2. 

Specifying the Type of a Literal 
We can override the default type of an integer, floating-point, or character literal by supplying a suffix or prefix as listed in Table 
2.2. 
L'a' // wide character literal, type is wchar_t u8"hi!" // utf-8 string literal (utf-8 encodes a Unicode character in 8 bits) 42ULL // unsigned integer literal, type is unsigned long long 1E-3F // single-precision floating-point literal, type is float 3.14159L // extended-precision floating-point literal, type is long double 



Best Practices 
When you write a long literal, use the uppercase L; the lowercase letter l is too easily mistaken for the digit 1. 
We can independently specify the signedness and size of an integral literal. If the suffix contains a U, then the literal has an unsigned type, so a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal literal with a U suffix has the smallest type of unsigned int, unsigned long, or unsigned long long in which the literal's value fits. If the suffix contains an L, then the literal's type will be at least long; if the suffix contains LL, then the literal's type will be either long long or unsigned long long. We can combine U with either L or LL. For example, a literal with a suffix of UL will be either unsigned long or unsigned long long, depending on whether its value fits in unsigned long. 
Boolean and Pointer Literals 
The words true and false are literals of type bool: bool test = false; The word nullptr is a pointer literal. We'll have more to say about pointers and nullptr in ¬ß 2.3.2 
(p. 52). 
Exercises Section 2.1.3 Exercise 2.5: Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain the differences among the literals in each of the four examples: 
(a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a" (b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC (c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L (d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2 Exercise 2.6: What, if any, are the differences between 
the following definitions: 
int month = 9, day = 7; int month = 09, day = 07; 
Exercise 2.7: What values do these literals represent? What type does each have? 
(a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012" (b) 3.14e1L (c) 1024f (d) 3.14L Exercise 2.8: Using escape sequences, write a 
program to print 2M followed by a newline. Modify the program to print 2, then a tab, then an M, followed by a newline. 


2.2. Variables 
A variable 
provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C++ has a type. The type determines the size and layout of the variable's memory, the range of values that can be stored within that memory, and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable. C++ programmers tend to refer to variables as 'variables' or 'objects' interchangeably. 

2.2.1. Variable Definitions 

A simple variable definition consists of a type 
specifier, followed by a list of one or more variable names separated by commas, and ends with a semicolon. Each name in the list has the type defined by the type specifier. A definition may (optionally) provide an initial value for one or more of the names it defines: 
int sum = 0, value, // sum, value, and units_sold have type int 
units_sold = 0; // sum and units_sold have initial value 0 
Sales_item item; // item has type Sales_item (see ¬ß 1.5.1 (p. 20)) 
// string is a library type, representing a variable-length sequence of 
characters 
std::string book("0-201-78345-X"); // book initialized from 
string literal 
The definition of book uses the std::string library type. Like iostream (¬ß 1.2, p. 7), string is defined in namespace std. We'll have more to say about the string type in Chapter 
3. For now, what's useful to know is that a string is a type that represents a variable-length sequence of characters. The string library gives us several ways to initialize string objects. One of these ways is as a copy of a string literal (¬ß 2.1.3, p. 39). Thus, book is initialized to hold the characters 0-201-78345-X. 

Terminology: What is an Object? 
C++ programmers tend to be cavalier in their use of the term object. Most generally, an object is a region of memory that can contain data and has a type. 
Some use the term object only to refer to variables or values of class types. Others distinguish between named and unnamed objects, using the term variable to refer to named objects. Still others distinguish between objects and values, using the term object for data that can be changed by the program and the term value for data that are read-only. 
In this book, we'll follow the more general usage that an object is a region of memory that has a type. We will freely use the term object regardless of whether the object has built-in or class type, is named or unnamed, or can be read or written. 
Initializers 
An object that is initialized 
gets the specified value at the moment it is created. The values used to initialize a variable can be arbitrarily complicated expressions. When a definition defines two or more variables, the name of each object becomes visible immediately. Thus, it is possible to initialize a variable to the value of one defined earlier in the same definition. 
// ok: price is defined and initialized before it is used to initialize discount 
double price = 109.99, discount = price * 0.16; 
// ok: call applyDiscount and use the return value to initialize salePrice 
double salePrice = applyDiscount(price, discount); 
Initialization in C++ is a surprisingly complicated topic and one we will return to again and again. Many programmers are confused by the use of the = symbol to initialize a variable. It is tempting to think of initialization as a form of assignment, but initialization and assignment are different operations in C++. This concept is particularly confusing because in many languages the distinction is irrelevant and can be ignored. Moreover, even in C++ the distinction often doesn't matter. Nonetheless, it is a crucial concept and one we will reiterate throughout the text. 



Warning 
Initialization is not assignment. Initialization happens when a variable is given a value when it is created. Assignment obliterates an object's current value and replaces that value with a new one. 
List Initialization 
One way in which initialization is a complicated topic is that the language defines several different forms of initialization. For example, we can use any of the following four different ways to define an int variable named units_sold and initialize it to 0: 
int units_sold = 0; 
int units_sold = {0}; 
int units_sold{0}; 
int units_sold(0); 
The generalized use of curly braces for initialization was introduced as part of the new standard. This form of initialization previously had been allowed only in more restricted ways. For reasons we'll learn about in ¬ß 3.3.1 
(p. 98), this form of initialization is referred to as list 
initialization. Braced lists of initializers can now be used whenever we initialize an object and in some cases when we assign a new value to an object. 

When used with variables of built-in type, this form of initialization has one important property: The compiler will not let us list initialize variables of built-in type if the initializer might lead to the loss of information: 
long double ld = 3.1415926536; 
int a{ld}, b = {ld}; // error: narrowing conversion required 
int c(ld), d = ld; // ok: but value will be truncated 
The compiler rejects the initializations of a and b because using a long double to initialize an int is likely to lose data. At a minimum, the fractional part of ld will be truncated. In addition, the integer part in ld might be too large to fit in an int. 
As presented here, the distinction might seem trivial'after all, we'd be unlikely to directly initialize an int from a long double. However, as we'll see in Chapter 
16, such initializations might happen unintentionally. We'll say more about these forms of initialization in ¬ß 3.2.1 
(p. 84) and ¬ß 3.3.1 
(p. 98). 

Default Initialization 
When we define a variable without an initializer, the variable is default 
initialized. Such variables are given the 'default' value. What that default value is depends on the type of the variable and may also depend on where the variable is defined. 
The value of an object of built-in type that is not explicitly initialized depends on where it is defined. Variables defined outside any function body are initialized to zero. With one exception, which we cover in ¬ß 6.1.1 
(p. 205), variables of built-in type defined inside a function are uninitialized. The value of an uninitialized variable of built-in type is undefined (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 36). It is an error to copy or otherwise try to access the value of a variable whose value is undefined. 
Each class controls how we initialize objects of that class type. In particular, it is up to the class whether we can define objects of that type without an initializer. If we can, the class determines what value the resulting object will have. 
Most classes let us define objects without explicit initializers. Such classes supply an appropriate default value for us. For example, as we've just seen, the library string class says that if we do not supply an initializer, then the resulting string is the empty string: 
std::string empty; // empty implicitly initialized to the empty string 
Sales_item item; // default-initialized Sales_item object 
Some classes require that every object be explicitly initialized. The compiler will complain if we try to create an object of such a class with no initializer. 



Note 
Uninitialized objects of built-in type defined inside a function body have undefined value. Objects of class type that we do not explicitly initialize have a value that is defined by the class.

Exercise 2.10: What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables? 
std::string global_str; int global_int; int main() { 
int local_int; std::string local_str; } 
2.2.2. Variable Declarations and Definitions 

To allow programs to be written in logical parts, C++ supports what is commonly known as separate 
compilation. Separate compilation lets us split our programs into several files, each of which can be compiled independently. 
When we separate a program into multiple files, we need a way to share code across those files. For example, code defined in one file may need to use a variable defined in another file. As a concrete example, consider std::cout and std::cin. These are objects defined somewhere in the standard library, yet our programs can use these objects. 

Caution: Uninitialized Variables Cause Run-Time Problems 
An uninitialized variable has an indeterminate value. Trying to use the value of an uninitialized variable is an error that is often hard to debug. Moreover, the compiler is not required to detect such errors, although most will warn about at least some uses of uninitialized variables. 
What happens when we use an uninitialized variable is undefined. Sometimes, we're lucky and our program crashes as soon as we access the object. Once we track down the location of the crash, it is usually easy to see that the variable was not properly initialized. Other times, the program completes but produces erroneous results. Even worse, the results may appear correct on one run of our program but fail on a subsequent run. Moreover, adding code to the program in an unrelated location can cause what we thought was a correct program to start producing incorrect results. 

Tip 
We recommend initializing every object of built-in type. It is not always necessary, but it is easier and safer to provide an initializer until you can be certain it is safe to omit the initializer. 
To support separate compilation, C++ distinguishes between declarations and definitions. A declaration 
makes a name known to the program. A file that wants to use a name defined elsewhere includes a declaration for that name. A definition 
creates the associated entity. 
A variable declaration specifies the type and name of a variable. A variable definition is a declaration. In addition to specifying the name and type, a definition also allocates storage and may provide the variable with an initial value. 
To obtain a declaration that is not also a definition, we add the extern keyword and may not provide an explicit initializer: 
extern int i; // declares but does not define i 
int j; // declares and defines j 
Any declaration that includes an explicit initializer is a definition. We can provide an initializer on a variable defined as extern, but doing so overrides the extern. An extern that has an initializer is a definition: 
extern double pi = 3.1416; // definition 
It is an error to provide an initializer on an extern inside a function. 


Note 
Variables must be defined exactly once but can be declared many times. 
The distinction between a declaration and a definition may seem obscure at this point but is actually important. To use a variable in more than one file requires declarations that are separate from the variable's definition. To use the same variable in multiple files, we must define that variable in one'and only one'file. Other files that use that variable must declare'but not define'that variable. 
We'll have more to say about how C++ supports separate compilation in ¬ß 2.6.3 
(p. 76) and ¬ß 6.1.3 
(p. 207). 
Exercises Section 2.2.2 Exercise 2.11: Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a definition: 
(a) extern  int  ix  =  1024;  
(b) int  iy;  
(c) extern  int  iz;  


Key Concept: Static Typing 
C++ is a statically typed language, which means that 
types are checked at compile time. The process by which types are checked is referred to as type 
checking. 
As we've seen, the type of an object constrains the operations that the object can perform. In C++, the compiler checks whether the operations we write are supported by the types we use. If we try to do things that the type does not support, the compiler generates an error message and does not produce an executable file. 
As our programs get more complicated, we'll see that static type checking can help find bugs. However, a consequence of static checking is that the type of every entity we use must be known to the compiler. As one example, we must declare the type of a variable before we can use that variable. 

2.2.3. Identifiers 
Identifiers 
in C++ can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. The language imposes no limit on name length. Identifiers must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Identifiers are case-sensitive; upper-and lowercase letters are distinct: 
// defines four different int variables 
int somename, someName, SomeName, SOMENAME; 
The language reserves a set of names, listed in Tables 
2.3 
and Table 
2.4, for its own use. These names may not be used as identifiers. 
Table 2.3. C++ Keywords 


The standard also reserves a set of names for use in the standard library. The identifiers we define in our own programs may not contain two consecutive underscores, nor can an identifier begin with an underscore followed immediately by an uppercase letter. In addition, identifiers defined outside a function may not begin with an underscore. 
Conventions for Variable Names 
There are a number of generally accepted conventions for naming variables. Following these conventions can improve the readability of a program. 
. 
An identifier should give some indication of its meaning. 

. 
Variable names normally are lowercase'index, not Index or INDEX. 

. 
Like Sales_item, classes we define usually begin with an uppercase letter. 

. 
Identifiers with multiple words should visually distinguish each word, for example, student_loan or studentLoan, not studentloan. 





Best Practices 
Naming conventions are most useful when followed consistently. 
Exercises Section 2.2.3 Exercise 2.12: Which, if any, of the following names are invalid? 
(a) 
int double = 3.14; 

(b) 
int _; (c) int catch-22; (d) int 1_or_2 = 1; 

(e) 
double Double = 3.14; 



2.2.4. Scope of a Name 

At any particular point in a program, each name that is in use refers to a specific entity'a variable, function, type, and so on. However, a given name can be reused to refer to different entities at different points in the program. 
A scope 
is a part of the program in which a name has a particular meaning. Most scopes in C++ are delimited by curly braces. 
The same name can refer to different entities in different scopes. Names are visible from the point where they are declared until the end of the scope in which the declaration appears. 
As an example, consider the program from ¬ß 1.4.2 
(p. 13): 
#include <iostream> 
int main() 
{ 
int sum = 0; 
// sum values from 1 through 10 inclusive 
for (int val = 1; val <= 10; ++val) sum += val; // equivalent to sum = sum + val std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is " << sum << std::endl; return 0; } 
This program defines three names'main, sum, and val'and uses the namespace name std, along with two names from that namespace'cout and endl. 
The name main is defined outside any curly braces. The name main'like 
most 
names 
defined 
outside 
a 
function'has 
global 
scope. 
Once 
declared, 
names 
at 
the 
global 
scope 
are 
accessible 
throughout the program. The name sum is defined within the scope of the block that is the body of the main function. It is accessible from its point of declaration throughout the rest of the main function but not outside of it. The variable sum has block scope. The name val is defined in the scope of the for statement. It can be used in that statement but not elsewhere in main. 

Advice: Define Variables Where You First Use Them 
It is usually a good idea to define an object near the point at which the object is first used. Doing so improves readability by making it easy to find the definition of the variable. More importantly, it is often easier to give the variable a useful initial value when the variable is defined close to where it is first used. 
Nested Scopes 
Scopes can contain other scopes. The contained (or nested) scope is referred to as an inner 
scope, the containing scope is the outer 
scope. 
Once a name has been declared in a scope, that name can be used by scopes nested inside that scope. Names declared in the outer scope can also be redefined in an inner scope: 
#include <iostream> 
// Program for illustration purposes only: It is bad style for a function 
// to use a global variable and also define a local variable with the same 
name 
int reused = 42; // reused has global scope 
int main() 
{ 
int unique = 0; // unique has block scope 
// output #1: uses global reused; prints 42 0 
std::cout << reused << " " << unique << std::endl; 
int reused = 0; // new, local object named reused hides global 
reused 
// output #2: uses local reused; prints 0 0 
std::cout << reused << " " << unique << std::endl; 
// output #3: explicitly requests the global reused; prints 42 0 
std::cout << ::reused << " " << unique << std::endl; 
return 0; 
} 
Output #1 appears before the local definition of reused. Therefore, this output statement uses the name reused that is defined in the global scope. This statement prints 42 0. Output #2 occurs after the local definition of reused. The local reused is now in 
scope. Thus, this second output statement uses the local object named reused rather than the global one and prints 
00. Output #3 uses the scope operator (¬ß 1.2, p. 8) to override the default scoping rules. The global scope has no name. 
Hence, when the scope operator has an empty left-hand side, it is a request to fetch the name on the right-hand side from the global scope. Thus, this expression uses the global reused and prints 42 0. 



Warning 
It is almost always a bad idea to define a local variable with the same name as a global variable that the function uses or might use. 

Exercises Section 2.2.4 
Exercise 2.13: What is the value of j in the following program? 
int i= 42; int main() { 
int i = 100; int j = i; } 
Exercise 2.14: Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed? 
int i= 100, sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i) sum += i; std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl; 

2.3. Compound Types 

A compound 
type 
is a type that is defined in terms of another type. C++ has several compound types, two of which' references and pointers'we'll cover in this chapter. 
Defining variables of compound type is more complicated than the declarations we've seen so far. In ¬ß 2.2 
(p. 41) we said that simple declarations consist of a type followed by a list of variable names. More generally, a declaration is a base 
type 
followed by a list of declarators. Each declarator names a variable and gives the variable a type that is related to the base type. 
The declarations we have seen so far have declarators that are nothing more than variable names. The type of such variables is the base type of the declaration. More complicated declarators specify variables with compound types that are built from the base type of the declaration. 
2.3.1. References 


Note 
The new standard introduced a new kind of reference: an 'rvalue reference,¬ß which we'll cover in ¬ß 13.6.1 
(p. 532). These references are primarily intended for use inside classes. Technically speaking, when we use the term reference, we mean 'lvalue reference.¬ß 
A reference 
defines an alternative name for an object. A reference type 'refers to' another type. We define a reference type by writing a declarator of the form &d, where d is the name being declared: 
int ival = 1024; 
int &refVal = ival; // refVal refers to (is another name for) ival 
int &refVal2; // error: a reference must be initialized 
Ordinarily, when we initialize a variable, the value of the initializer is copied into the object we are creating. When we define a reference, instead of copying the initializer's value, we bind 
the reference to its initializer. Once initialized, a reference remains bound to its initial object. There is no way to rebind a reference to refer to a different object. Because there is no way to rebind a reference, references must be initialized. 
A Reference Is an Alias 



Note 
A reference is not an object. Instead, a reference is just another name for an already existing object. 
After a reference has been defined, all operations on that reference are actually operations on the object to which the reference is bound: 
refVal = 2; // assigns 2 to the object to which refVal refers, i.e., to ival int ii = refVal; // same as ii = ival 
When we assign to a reference, we are assigning to the object to which the reference is bound. When we fetch the value of a reference, we are really fetching the value of the object to which the reference is bound. Similarly, when we use a reference as an initializer, we are really using the object to which the reference is bound: 
// ok: refVal3 is bound to the object to which refVal is bound, i.e., to ival 
int &refVal3 = refVal; // initializes i from the value in the object to which refVal is bound int i = refVal; // ok: initializes i to the same value as ival 
Because references are not objects, we may not define a reference to a reference. 
Reference Definitions 
We can define multiple references in a single definition. Each identifier that is a reference must be preceded by the & symbol: 
int i = 1024, i2 = 2048; // i and i2 are both ints int &r =i, r2 =i2; // r is a reference bound to i; r2 is an int int i3 = 1024, &ri = i3; // i3 is an int; ri is a reference bound to i3 int &r3 =i3, &r4 =i2; // both r3 and r4 are references 
With two exceptions that we'll cover in ¬ß 2.4.1 
(p. 61) and ¬ß 
15.2.3 
(p. 601), the type of a reference and the object to which the reference refers must match exactly. Moreover, for reasons we'll explore in ¬ß 2.4.1, a reference may be bound only to an object, not to a literal or to the result of a more general expression: 
int &refVal4 = 10; // error: initializer must be an object double dval = 3.14; int &refVal5 = dval; // error: initializer must be an int object 
Exercises Section 2.3.1 Exercise 2.15: Which of the following definitions, if any, are invalid? Why?

int ival = 1.01; (b) int &rval1 = 1.01; 

(c)

(d) int &rval3; 
Exercise 2.16: Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do.

(c) i = r2; 
(d) r1 = d; Exercise 2.17: What does the following code print? 
int i, &ri = i; i = 5; ri = 10; std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl; 
2.3.2. Pointers 

A pointer 
is a compound type that 'points to' another type. Like references, pointers are used for indirect access to other objects. Unlike a reference, a pointer is an object in its own right. Pointers can be assigned and copied; a single pointer can point to several different objects over its lifetime. Unlike a reference, a pointer need not be initialized at the time it is defined. Like other built-in types, pointers defined at block scope have undefined value if they are not initialized. 



Warning 
Pointers are often hard to understand. Debugging 
problems due to pointer errors bedevil even experienced programmers. 
We define a pointer type by writing a declarator of the form *d, where d is the name being defined. The * must be repeated for each pointer variable: 
int *ip1, *ip2; // both ip1 and ip2 are pointers to int 
double dp, *dp2; // dp2 is a pointer to double; dp is a double 
Taking the Address of an Object 
A pointer holds the address of another object. We get the address 
of 
an 
object 
by 
usin 
the 
address-of 
operator 
(the 
& 
operator): 

int ival = 42; 
int *p = &ival; // p holds the address of ival; p is a pointer to ival 
The second statement defines p as a pointer to int and initializes p to point to the int object named ival. Because references are not objects, they don't have addresses. Hence, we may not define a pointer to a reference. 
With two exceptions, which we cover in ¬ß 2.4.2 
(p. 62) and ¬ß 
15.2.3 
(p. 601), the types of the pointer and the object to which it points must match: 
double dval; double *pd = &dval; // ok: initializer is the address of a double double *pd2 = pd; // ok: initializer is a pointer to double int *pi = pd; // error: types of pi and pd differ pi = &dval; // error: assigning the address of a double to a pointer to int 
The types must match because the type of the pointer is used to infer the type of the object to which the pointer points. If a pointer addressed an object of another type, operations performed on the underlying object would fail. 

Pointer Value 
The value (i.e., the address) stored in a pointer can be in one of four states: 
1. 
It can point to an object. 

2. 
It can point to the location just immediately past the end of an object. 

3. 
It can be a null pointer, indicating that it is not bound to any object. 

4. 
It can be invalid; values other than the preceding three 


are invalid. It is an error to copy or otherwise try to access the value of an invalid pointer. As when we use an uninitialized variable, this error is one that the compiler is unlikely to detect. The result of accessing an invalid pointer is undefined. Therefore, we must always know whether a given pointer is valid. 
Although pointers in cases 2 and 3 are valid, there are limits on what we can do with such pointers. Because these pointers do not point to any object, we may not use them to access the (supposed) object to which the pointer points. If we do attempt to access an object through such pointers, the behavior is undefined. 

Using a Pointer to Access an Object 
When a pointer points to an object, we can use the dereference operator (the * 
operator) to access that object: 
int ival = 42; 
int *p = &ival; // p holds the address of ival; p is a pointer to ival 
cout << *p; // * yields the object to which p points; prints 42 
Dereferencing a pointer yields the object to which the pointer points. We can assign to that object by assigning to the result of the dereference: 
*p =0; // * yields the object; we assign a new value to ival through p cout << *p; // prints 0 
When we assign to *p, we are assigning to the object to which p points. 



Note 
We may dereference only a valid pointer that points to an object. 

Key Concept: Some Symbols Have Multiple Meanings 
Some symbols, such as & and *, are used as both an operator in an expression and as part of a declaration. The context in which a symbol is used determines what the symbol means: 
int i= 42; int &r =i; // & follows a type and is part of a declaration; r is a reference int *p; // * follows a type and is part of a declaration; p is a pointer p=&i; //& is used in an expression as the address-of operator *p =i; // * is used in an expression as the dereference operator int &r2 = *p; // & is part of the declaration; * is the dereference operator 
In declarations, & and * are used to form compound types. In expressions, these same symbols are used to denote an operator. Because the same symbol is used with very different meanings, it can be helpful to ignore appearances and think of them as if they were different symbols. 
Null Pointers 
A null 
pointer 
does not point to any object. Code can check whether a pointer is null before attempting to use it. There are several ways to obtain a null pointer: 
int *p1 = nullptr; // equivalent to int *p1 = 0; int *p2 =0; // directly initializes p2 from the literal constant 0 // must #include cstdlib int *p3 = NULL; // equivalent to int *p3 = 0; 

The most direct approach is to initialize the pointer using the literal nullptr, which was introduced by the new standard. nullptr is a literal that has a special type that can be converted (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 35) to any other pointer type. Alternatively, we can initialize a pointer to the literal 0, as we do in the definition of p2. 
Older programs sometimes use a preprocessor 
variable 
named NULL, which the cstdlib header defines as 0. 
We'll describe the preprocessor in a bit more detail in ¬ß 2.6.3 

(p. 77). What's useful to know now is that the preprocessor is a program that runs before the compiler. Preprocessor variables are managed by the preprocessor, and are not part of the std namespace. As a result, we refer to them directly without the std:: prefix. 
When we use a preprocessor variable, the preprocessor automatically replaces the variable by its value. Hence, initializing a pointer to NULL is equivalent to initializing it to 0. ModernC++ programs generally should avoid using NULL and use nullptr instead. 
It is illegal to assign an int variable to a pointer, even if the variable's value happens to be 0. 
int zero = 0; 
pi = zero; // error: cannot assign an int to a pointer 


Advice: Initialize all Pointers 
Uninitialized pointers are a common source of run-time errors. 
As with any other uninitialized variable, what happens when we use an uninitialized pointer is undefined. Using an uninitialized pointer almost always results in a run.time crash. However, debugging the resulting crashes can be surprisingly hard. 
Under most compilers, when we use an uninitialized pointer, the bits in the memory in which the pointer resides are used as an address. Using an uninitialized pointer is a request to access a supposed object at that supposed location. There is no way to distinguish a valid address from an invalid one formed from the bits that happen to be in the memory in which the pointer was allocated. 
Our recommendation to initialize all variables is particularly important for pointers. If possible, define a pointer only after the object to which it should point has been defined. If there is no object to bind to a pointer, then initialize the pointer to nullptr or zero. That way, the program can detect that the pointer does not point to an object. 
Assignment and Pointers 
Both pointers and references give indirect access to other objects. However, there are important differences in how they do so. The most important is that a reference is not an object. Once we have defined a reference, there is no way to make that reference refer to a different object. When we use a reference, we always get the object to which the reference was initially bound. 
There is no such identity between a pointer and the address that it holds. As with any other (nonreference) variable, when we assign to a pointer, we give the pointer itself a new value. Assignment makes the pointer point to a different object: 
int i= 42; 
int *pi =0; // pi is initialized but addresses no object 
int *pi2 = &i; // pi2 initialized to hold the address of i 
int *pi3; // if pi3 is defined inside a block, pi3 is uninitialized 
pi3 = pi2; // pi3 and pi2 address the same object, e.g., i 
pi2 =0; // pi2 now addresses no object 
It can be hard to keep straight whether an assignment changes the pointer or the object to which the pointer points. The important thing to keep in mind is that assignment changes its left-hand operand. When we write 
pi = &ival; // value in pi is changed; pi now points to ival 
we assign a new value to pi, which changes the address that pi holds. On the other hand, when we write 
*pi =0; // value in ival is changed; pi is unchanged then *pi (i.e., the value to which pi points) is changed. 
Other Pointer Operations 
So long as the pointer has a valid value, we can use a pointer in 
a condition. Just as when we use an arithmetic value in a condition (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 35), if the pointer is 0, then the condition is false: 
int ival = 1024; 
int *pi =0; // pi is a valid, null pointer 
int *pi2 = &ival; // pi2 is a valid pointer that holds the address of ival 
if (pi) // pi has value 0, so condition evaluates as false 
// ... if (pi2) // pi2 points to ival, so it is not 0; the condition evaluates as true // ... Any nonzero pointer evaluates as true 
Given two valid pointers of the same type, we can compare them using the equality (==) or inequality (!=) operators. The result of these operators has type bool. Two pointers are equal if they hold the same address and unequal otherwise. Two pointers hold the same address (i.e., are equal) if they are both null, if they address the same object, or if they are both pointers one past the same object. Note that it is possible for a pointer to an object and a pointer one past the end of a different object to hold the same address. Such pointers will compare equal. 
Because these operations use the value of the pointer, a pointer used in a condition or in a comparsion must be a valid pointer. Using an invalid pointer as a condition or in a comparison is undefined. 
¬ß 3.5.3 
(p. 117) will cover additional pointer operations. 

void* Pointers 
The type void* 
is a special pointer type that can hold the address of any object. Like any other pointer, a void* pointer holds an address, but the type of the object at that address is unknown: 
double obj = 3.14, *pd = &obj; 
// ok: void* can hold the address value of any data pointer type 
void *pv = &obj; // obj can be an object of any type 
pv =pd; // pv can hold a pointer to any type 
There are only a limited number of things we can do with a void* pointer: We can compare it to another pointer, we can pass it to or return it from a function, and we can assign it to another void* pointer. We cannot use a void* to operate on the object it addresses'we don't know that object's type, and the type determines what operations we can perform on the object. 
Generally, we use a void* pointer to deal with memory as memory, rather than using the pointer to access the object stored in that memory. We'll cover using void* pointers in this way in ¬ß 19.1.1 
(p. 821). ¬ß 4.11.3 
(p. 163) will show how we can retrieve the address stored in a void* pointer.

2.3.3. Understanding Compound Type Declarations 

As we've seen, a variable definition consists of a base type and a list of declarators. Each declarator can relate its variable to the base type differently from the other declarators in the same definition. Thus, a single definition might define variables of different types: 
// i is an int; p is a pointer to int; r is a reference to int 
int i= 1024, *p = &i, &r =i; 


Warning 
Many programmers are confused by the interaction between the base type and the type modification that may be part of a declarator. 
Defining Multiple Variables 

It is a common misconception to think that the type modifier (* or &) applies to all the variables defined in a single statement. Part of the problem arises because we can put whitespace between the type modifier and the name being declared: 
int* p; // legal but might be misleading 
We say that this definition might be misleading because it suggests that int* is the type of each variable declared in that statement. Despite appearances, the base type of this declaration is int, not int*. The * modifies the type of p. It says nothing about any other objects that might be declared in the same statement: 
int* p1, p2; // p1 is a pointer to int; p2 is an int 
There are two common styles used to define multiple variables with pointer or reference type. The first places the type modifier adjacent to the identifier: 
int *p1, *p2; // both p1 and p2 are pointers to int 
This style emphasizes that the variable has the indicated compound type. 
The second places the type modifier with the type but defines only one variable per statement: 
int* p1; // p1 is a pointer to int 
int* p2; // p2 is a pointer to int This style emphasizes that the declaration defines a compound type. 

Tip 
There is no single right way to define pointers or references. The important thing is to choose a style and 
use it consistently. 
In this book we use the first style and place the * (or the &) with the variable name. 

Pointers to Pointers 
In general, there are no limits to how many type modifiers can be applied to a declarator. When there is more than one modifier, they combine in ways that are logical but not always obvious. As one example, consider a pointer. A pointer is an object in memory, so like any object it has an address. Therefore, we can store the address of a pointer in another pointer. 
We indicate each pointer level by its own *. That is, we write ** for a pointer to a pointer, *** for a pointer to a pointer to a pointer, and so on: 
int ival = 1024; 
int *pi = &ival; // pi points to an int 
int **ppi = &pi; // ppi points to a pointer to an int 
Here pi is a pointer to an int and ppi is a pointer to a pointer to an int. We might represent these objects as 

Just as dereferencing a pointer to an int yields an int, dereferencing a pointer to a pointer yields a pointer. To access the underlying object, we must dereference the original pointer twice: 
cout << "The value of ival\n" << "direct value: " << ival << "\n" << "indirect value: " << *pi << "\n" << "doubly indirect value: " << **ppi << endl; 
This program prints the value of ival three different ways: first, directly; then, through the pointer to int in pi; and finally, by dereferencing ppi twice to get to the underlying value in ival. 

References to Pointers 
A reference is not an object. Hence, we may not have a pointer to a reference. However, because a pointer is an object, we can define a reference to a pointer: 
int i= 42; int *p; // p is a pointer to int int *&r =p; // r is a reference to the pointer p r = &i; // r refers to a pointer; assigning &i to r makes p point to i *r = 0; // dereferencing r yields i, the object to which p points; changes i to 0 
The easiest way to understand the type of r is to read the definition right to left. The symbol closest to the name of the variable (in this case the & in &r) is the one that has the most immediate effect on the variable's type. Thus, we know that r is a reference. The rest of the declarator determines the type to which r refers. The next symbol, * in this case, says that the type r refers to is a pointer type. Finally, the base type of the declaration says that r is a reference to a pointer to an int. 

Tip 
It can be easier to understand complicated pointer or reference declarations if you read them from right to left. 
Exercises Section 2.3.3 Exercise 2.25: Determine the types and values of each of the following variables. 
(a) 
int* ip, &r = ip; 

(b) 
int i, *ip = 0; 

(c) 
int* ip, ip2; 




2.4. const Qualifier 

Sometimes we want to define a variable whose value we know cannot be changed. For example, we might want to use a variable to refer to the size of a buffer size. Using a variable makes it easy for us to change the size of the buffer if we decided the original size wasn't what we needed. On the other hand, we'd also like to prevent code from inadvertently giving a new value to the variable we use to represent the buffer size. We can make a variable unchangeable by defining the variable's type as const: 
const int bufSize = 512; // input buffer size 
defines bufSize as a constant. Any attempt to assign to bufSize is an error: 
bufSize = 512; // error: attempt to write to const object 
Because we can't change the value of a const object after we create it, it must be initialized. As usual, the initializer may be an arbitrarily complicated expression: 
const int i = get_size(); // ok: initialized at run time 
const int j = 42; // ok: initialized at compile time 
const int k; // error: k is uninitialized const 

Initialization and const 
As we have observed many times, the type of an object defines the operations that can be performed by that object. A const type can use most but not all of the same operations as its nonconst version. The one restriction is that we may use only those operations that cannot change an object. So, for example, we can use a const int in arithmetic expressions in exactly the same way as a plain, nonconst int.A const int converts to bool the same way as a plain int, and so on. 
Among the operations that don't change the value of an object is initialization'when we use an object to initialize another object, it doesn't matter whether either or both of the objects are consts: 
int i= 42; 
const int ci = i; // ok: the value in i is copied into ci 
int j=ci; // ok: the value in ci is copied into j 
Although ci is a const int, the value in ci is an int. The constness of ci matters only for operations that might change 
ci. When we copy ci to initialize j, we don't care that ci is a const. Copying an object doesn't change that object. Once the copy is made, the new object has no further access to the original object. 

By Default, const Objects Are Local to a File 
When a const object is initialized from a compile-time constant, such as in our definition of bufSize: 
const int bufSize = 512; // input buffer size 
the compiler will usually replace uses of the variable with its corresponding value during compilation. That is, the compiler will generate code using the value 512 in the places that our code uses bufSize. 
To substitute the value for the variable, the compiler has to see the variable's initializer. When we split a program into multiple files, every file that uses the const must have access to its initializer. In order to see the initializer, the variable must be defined in every file that wants to use the variable's value (¬ß 2.2.2, p. 45). To support this usage, yet avoid multiple definitions of the same variable, const variables are defined as local to the file. When we define a const with the same name in multiple files, it is as if we had written definitions for separate variables in each file. 
Sometimes we have a const variable that we want to share across multiple files but whose initializer is not a constant expression. In this case, we don't want the compiler to generate a separate variable in each file. Instead, we want the const object to behave like other (nonconst) variables. We want to define the const in one file, and declare it in the other files that use that object. 
To define a single instance of a const variable, we use the keyword extern on both its definition and declaration(s): 
// file_1.cc defines and initializes a const that is accessible to other files 
extern const int bufSize = fcn(); 
// file_1.h 
extern const int bufSize; // same bufSize as defined in file_1.cc 
In this program, file_1.cc defines and initializes bufSize. Because this declaration includes an initializer, it is (as usual) a definition. However, because bufSize is const, we must specify extern in order for bufSize to be used in other files. 
The declaration in file_1.h is also extern. In this case, the extern signifies that bufSize is not local to this file and that its definition will occur elsewhere. 


Note 
To share a const object among multiple files, you must define the variable as extern.

2.4.1. References to const 

As with any other object, we can bind a reference to an object of a const type. To do so we use a reference 
to 
const, which is a reference that refers to a const type. Unlike an ordinary reference, a reference to const cannot be used to change the object to which the reference is bound: 
const int ci = 1024; 
const int &r1 = ci; // ok: both reference and underlying object are 
const 
r1 =42; // error: r1 is a reference to const 
int &r2 = ci; // error: non const reference to a const object 
Because we cannot assign directly to ci, we also should not be able to use a reference to change ci. Therefore, the initialization of r2 is an error. If this initialization were legal, we could use r2 to change the value of its underlying object. 

Terminology: const Reference is a Reference to const 
C++ programmers tend to abbreviate the phrase 'reference to const' as 'const reference.¬ß This abbreviation makes sense'if you remember that it is an abbreviation. 
Technically speaking, there are no const references. A reference is not an object, so we cannot make a reference itself const. Indeed, because there is no way to make a reference refer to a different object, in some sense all references are const. Whether a reference refers to a const or nonconst type affects what we can do with that reference, not whether we can alter the binding of the reference itself. 
Initialization and References to const 
In ¬ß 2.3.1 
(p. 51) we noted that there are two exceptions to the rule that the type of a reference must match the type of the object to which it refers. The first exception is that we can initialize a reference to const from any expression that can be converted (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 35) to the type of the reference. In particular, we can bind a reference to const to a nonconst object, a literal, or a more general expression: 
int i= 42; const int &r1 = i; // we can bind a const int& to a plain int object const int &r2 = 42; // ok: r1 is a reference to const const int &r3 = r1 * 2; // ok: r3 is a reference to const int &r4 =r*2; // error: r4 is a plain, non const reference 
The easiest way to understand this difference in initialization rules is to consider what happens when we bind a reference to an object of a different type: 
double dval = 3.14; 
const int &ri = dval; 
Here ri refers to an int. Operations on ri will be integer operations, but dval is a floating-point number, not an integer. To ensure that the object to which ri is bound is an int, the compiler transforms this code into something like 
const int temp = dval; // create a temporary const int from the 
double 
const int &ri = temp; // bind ri to that temporary 
In this case, ri is bound to a temporary 
object. A temporary object is an unnamed object created by the compiler when it needs a place to store a result from evaluating an expression. C++ programmers often use the word temporary as an abbreviation for temporary object. 
Now consider what could happen if this initialization were allowed but ri was not const. If ri weren't const, we could assign to ri. Doing so would change the object to which ri is bound. That object is a temporary, not dval. The programmer who made ri refer to dval would probably expect that assigning to ri would change dval. After all, why assign to ri unless the intent is to change the object to which ri is bound? Because binding a reference to a temporary is almost surely not what the programmer intended, the language makes it illegal. 

A Reference to const May Refer to an Object That Is Not const 
It is important to realize that a reference to const restricts only what we can do through that reference. Binding a reference to const to an object says nothing about whether the underlying object itself is const. Because the underlying object might be nonconst, it might be changed by other means: 
int i= 42; int &r1 =i; // r1 bound to i const int &r2 = i; // r2 also bound to i; but cannot be used to change i r1 =0; // r1 is not const; i is now 0 r2 =0; // error: r2 is a reference to const 
Binding r2 to the (nonconst) int i is legal. However, we cannot use r2 to change i. Even so, the value in i still might change. We can change i by assigning to it directly, or by assigning to another reference bound to i, such as r1. 
2.4.2. Pointers and const 

As with references, we can define pointers that point to either const 
or 
nonconst 
types. 
Like 
a 
reference 
to 
const,a 
pointer 
to 
const 
(¬ß 
2.4.1, 
p. 
61) 
may 
not 
be 
used 
to 
change 
the 
object 
to 
which the pointer points. We may store the address of a const object only in a pointer to const: 
const double pi = 3.14; // pi is const; its value may not be changed double *ptr = &pi; // error: ptr is a plain pointer const double *cptr = &pi; // ok: cptr may point to a double that is const *cptr = 42; // error: cannot assign to *cptr 
In ¬ß 2.3.2 
(p. 52) we noted that there are two exceptions to the rule that the types of a pointer and the object to which it points must match. The first exception is that we can use a pointer to const to point to a nonconst object: 
double dval = 3.14; // dval is a double; its value can be changed cptr = &dval; // ok: but can't change dval through cptr 
Like a reference to const, a pointer to const says nothing about whether the object to which the pointer points is const. Defining a pointer as a pointer to const affects only what we can do with the pointer. It is important to remember that there is no guarantee that an object pointed to by a pointer to const won't change. 

Tip 
It may be helpful to think of pointers and references to const as pointers or references 'that think they point or refer to const.¬ß 


const Pointers 
Unlike references, pointers are objects. Hence, as with any other object type, we can have a pointer that is itself const. Like any other const object, a const pointer must be initialized, and once initialized, its value (i.e., the address that it holds) may not be changed. We indicate that the pointer is const by putting the const after the *. This placement indicates that it is the pointer, not the pointed-to type, that is const: 
int errNumb = 0; int *const curErr = &errNumb; // curErr will always point to errNumb 
const double pi = 3.14159; const double *const pip = &pi; // pip is a const pointer to a const object 
As we saw in ¬ß 2.3.3 
(p. 58), the easiest way to understand these declarations is to read them from right to left. In this case, the symbol closest to curErr is const, which means that curErr itself will be a const object. The type of that object is formed from the rest of the declarator. The next symbol in the declarator is *, which means that curErr is a const pointer. Finally, the base type of the declaration completes the type of curErr, which is a const pointer to an object of type int. Similarly, pip is a const pointer to an object of type const double. 
The fact that a pointer is itself const says nothing about whether we can use the pointer to change the underlying object. Whether we can change that object depends entirely on the type to which the pointer points. For example, pip is a const pointer to const. Neither the value of the object addressed by pip nor the address stored in pip can be changed. On the other hand, curErr addresses a plain, nonconst int. We can use curErr to change the value of errNumb: 
*pip = 2.72; // error: pip is a pointer to const // if the object to which curErr points (i.e., errNumb) is nonzero if (*curErr) { 
errorHandler(); 
*curErr = 0; // ok: reset the value of the object to which curErr is bound 
} 


2.4.3. Top-Level const 

As we've seen, a pointer is an object that can point to a different object. As a result, we can talk independently about whether a pointer is const and whether the objects to which it can point are const. We use the term top-level 
const 
to indicate that the pointer itself is a const. When a pointer can point to a const object, we refer to that const as a low-level 
const. 
Exercises Section 2.4.2 Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why. 
(a) 
int i = -1, &r = 0; 

(b) 
int *const p2 = &i2; 

(c)

(d) 
const int *const p3 = &i2; 

(e)

(g) 
const int i2 = i, &r = i; 


Exercise 2.28: Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal. 
(a) 
int i, *const cp; 

(b) int *p1, *const p2; 

(c) 
const int ic, &r = ic; 

(d) 
const int *const p3; 

(e) 
const int *p; 


Exercise 2.29: Uing the variables in the previous exercise, which of the following assignments are legal? Explain why. 
(a) 
i = ic; (b) p1 = p3; 

(c) 
p1 = &ic; 

(d) 
p3 = &ic; (e) p2 = p1; 

(f) 
ic = *p3; 


More generally, top-level const indicates that an object itself is const. Top-level const can appear in any object type, i.e., one of the built-in arithmetic types, a class type, or a pointer type. Low-level const appears in the base type of compound types such as pointers or references. Note that pointer types, unlike most other types, can have both top-level and low-level const independently: 
int i= 0; int *const p1 = &i; // we can't change the value of p1; const is top-level const int ci = 42; // we cannot change ci; const is top-level const int *p2 = &ci; // we can change p2; const is low-level const int *const p3 = p2; // right-most const is top-level, left-most is not const int &r = ci; // const in reference types is always low-level 

The distinction between top-level and low-level matters when we copy an object. When we copy an object, top-level consts are ignored: 
i = ci; // ok: copying the value of ci; top-level const in ci is ignored p2 = p3; // ok: pointed-to type matches; top-level const in p3 is ignored 
Copying an object doesn't change the copied object. As a result, it is immaterial whether the object copied from or copied into is const. 
On the other hand, low-level const is never ignored. When we copy an object, both objects must have the same low-level const qualification or there must be a conversion between the types of the two objects. In general, we can convert a nonconst to const but not the other way round: 
int *p = p3; // error: p3 has a low-level const but p doesn't 
p2 =p3; // ok: p2 has the same low-level const qualification as p3 
p2 =&i; // ok: we can convert int* to const int* 
int &r = ci; // error: can't bind an ordinary int& to a const int object 
const int &r2 = i; // ok: can bind const int& to plain int 
p3 has both a top-level and low-level const. When we copy p3, we can ignore its top-level const but not the fact that it points to a const type. Hence, we cannot use p3 to initialize p, which points to a plain (nonconst) int. On the other hand, we can assign p3 to p2. Both pointers have the same (low-level const) type. The fact that p3 is a const pointer (i.e., that it has a top-level const) doesn't matter. 
Exercises Section 2.4.3 Exercise 2.30: For each of the following declarations indicate whether the object being declared has top-level or low-level const. 
const int v2 = 0; int v1 = v2; int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1; const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2; 
Exercise 2.31: Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or low-level const applies in each case. 
r1 = v2; p1 =p2; p2 =p1; p1 =p3; p2 =p3; 

2.4.4. constexpr and Constant Expressions 

A constant 
expression 
is an expression whose value cannot change and that can be evaluated at compile time. A literal is a constant expression. A const object that is initialized from a constant expression is also a constant expression. As we'll see, there are several contexts in the language that require constant expressions. 
Whether a given object (or expression) is a constant expression depends on the types and the initializers. For example: 
const int max_files = 20; // max_files is a constant expression 
const int limit = max_files + 1; // limit is a constant expression 
int staff_size = 27; // staff_size is not a constant expression 
const int sz = get_size(); // sz is not a constant expression 
Although staff_size is initialized from a literal, it is not a constant expression because it is a plain int, not a const int. On the other hand, even though sz is a const, the value of its initializer is not known until run time. Hence, sz is not a constant expression. 
constexpr Variables 
In a large system, it can be difficult to determine (for certain) that an initializer is a constant expression. We might define a const variable with an initializer that we think is a constant expression. However, when we use that variable in a context that requires a constant expression we may discover that the initializer was not a constant expression. In general, the definition of an object and its use in such a context can be widely separated. 

Under the new standard, we can ask the compiler to verify that a variable is a constant expression by declaring the variable in a constexpr 
declaration. Variables declared as constexpr are implicitly const and must be initialized by constant expressions: 
constexpr int mf = 20; // 20 is a constant expression constexpr int limit = mf + 1; // mf + 1 is a constant expression constexpr int sz = size(); // ok only if size is a constexpr function 
Although we cannot use an ordinary function as an initializer for a constexpr variable, we'll see in ¬ß 6.5.2 
(p. 239) that the new standard lets us define certain functions as constexpr. Such functions must be simple enough that the compiler can evaluate them at compile time. We can use constexpr functions in the initializer of a constexpr variable. 



Best Practices 
Generally, it is a good idea to use constexpr for variables that you intend to use as constant expressions. 
Literal Types 
Because a constant expression is one that can be evaluated at compile time, there are limits on the types that we can use in a constexpr declaration. The types we can use in a constexpr are known as 'literal types' because they are simple enough to have literal values. 
Of the types we have used so far, the arithmetic, reference, and pointer types are literal types. Our Sales_item class and the library IO and string types are not literal types. Hence, we cannot define variables of these types as constexprs. We'll see other kinds of literal types in ¬ß 7.5.6 
(p. 299) and ¬ß 19.3 
(p. 832). 
Although we can define both pointers and reference as constexprs, the objects we use to initialize them are strictly limited. We can initialize a constexpr pointer from the nullptr literal or the literal (i.e., constant expression) 0. We can also point to (or bind to) an object that remains at a fixed address. 
For reasons we'll cover in ¬ß 6.1.1 
(p. 204), variables defined inside a function ordinarily are not stored at a fixed address. Hence, we cannot use a constexpr pointer to point to such variables. On the other hand, the address of an object defined outside of any function is a constant expression, and so may be used to initialize a constexpr pointer. We'll see in ¬ß 6.1.1 
(p. 205), that functions may define variables that exist across calls to that function. Like an object defined outside any function, these special local objects also have fixed addresses. Therefore, a constexpr reference may be bound to, and a constexpr pointer may address, such variables. 

Pointers and constexpr 
It is important to understand that when we define a pointer in a constexpr declaration, the constexpr specifier applies to the pointer, not the type to which the pointer points: 
const int *p = nullptr; // p is a pointer to a const int 
constexpr int *q = nullptr; // q is a const pointer to int 
Despite appearances, the types of p and q are quite different; p is a pointer to const, whereas q is a constant pointer. The difference is a consequence of the fact that constexpr imposes a top-level const (¬ß 2.4.3, p. 63) on the objects it defines. 
Like any other constant pointer, a constexpr pointer may point to a const or a nonconst type: 
constexpr int *np = nullptr; // np is a constant pointer to int that 
is null 
int j = 0; 
constexpr int i = 42; // type of i is const int 
// i and j must be defined outside any function 
constexpr const int *p = &i; // p is a constant pointer to the const 
int i 
constexpr int *p1 = &j; // p1 is a constant pointer to the int j 
Exercises Section 2.4.4 Exercise 2.32: Is the following code legal or not? If not, how might you make it legal? 
int null = 0, *p = null; 

### 2.5. Dealing with Types 

As our programs get more complicated, we‚Äôll see that the types we use also get more complicated. Complications in using types arise in two different ways. Some types are hard to ‚Äúspell.‚Äù That is, they have forms that are tedious and error-prone to write. Moreover, the form of a complicated type can obscure its purpose or meaning. The other source of complication is that sometimes it is hard to determine the exact type we need. Doing so can require us to look back into the context of the program.

#### 2.5.1 Type Aliases

A type alias is a name that is a synonym for another type. Type aliases let us simplify complicated type definitions, making those types easier to use. Type aliases also let us emphasize the purpose for which a type is used.

We can define a type alias in one of two ways. Traditionally, we use a `typedef`:

```C++
typedef double wages; // wages is a synonym for double
typedef wages base, *p; // base is a synonym for double, p for double*
```

The keyword `typedef` may appear as part of the base type of a declaration (¬ß 2.3, p. 50). Declarations that include `typedef` define type aliases rather than variables. As in any other declaration, the declarators can include type modifiers that define compound types built from the base type of the definition.

üÜïThe new standard introduced a second way to define a type alias, via an **alias declaration**:

```C++
using SI = Sales_item; // SI is a synonym for Sales_item
```

An alias declaration starts with the keyword `using` followed by the alias name and an `=`. The alias declaration defines the name on the left-hand side of the = as an alias for the type that appears on the right-hand side.

A type alias is a type name and can appear wherever a type name can appear:

```C++
wages hourly, weekly; // same as double hourly, weekly;
SI item; // same as Sales_item item
```

##### Pointers, const, and Type Aliases

üîçDeclarations that use type aliases that represent compound types and `const` can yield surprising results. For example, the following declarations use the type `pstring`, which is an alias for the the type `char*`:

```C++
typedef char *pstring;
const pstring cstr = 0; // cstr is a constant pointer to char
const pstring *ps; // ps is a pointer to a constant pointer to char
```

The base type in these declarations is `const pstring`. As usual, a const that appears in the base type modifies the given type. The type of `pstring` is ‚Äúpointer to `char`.‚Äù So, `const pstring` is a constant pointer to `char`‚Äînot a pointer to `const char`.

It can be tempting, albeit incorrect, to interpret a declaration that uses a type alias by conceptually replacing the alias with its corresponding type:

```c++
const char *cstr = 0; // wrong interpretation of const pstring cstr
```

However, this interpretation is wrong. When we use `pstring` in a declaration, the base type of the declaration is a pointer type. When we rewrite the declaration using `char*`, the base type is `char` and the ` * ` is part of the declarator. In this case, `const char` is the base type. This rewrite declares `cstr` as a pointer to const char rather than as a `const` pointer to `char`.

#### 2.5.2 The `auto` Type Specifier

üÜïIt is not uncommon to want to store the value of an expression in a variable. To declare the variable, we have to know the type of that expression. When we write a program, it can be surprisingly difficult‚Äîand sometimes even impossible‚Äîto determine the type of an expression. Under the new standard, we can let the compiler figure out the type for us by using the **auto** type specifier. Unlike type specifiers, such as `double`, that name a specific type, `auto` tells the compiler to deduce the type from the initializer. By implication, a variable that uses `auto` as its type specifier must have an initializer:

```c++
// the type of item is deduced from the type of the result of adding val1 and val2
auto item = val1 + val2; // item initialized to the result of val1 + val2
```

Here the compiler will deduce the type of `item` from the type returned by applying `+` to `val1` and `val2`. If `val1` and `val2` are `Sales_item` objects (¬ß 1.5, p. 19), `item` will have type `Sales_item`. If those variables are type `double`, then `item` has type `double`, and so on.

As with any other type specifier, we can define multiple variables using `auto`. Because a declaration can involve only a single base type, the initializers for all the variables in the declaration must have types that are consistent with each other:

```c++
auto i = 0, *p = &i; // ok: i is int and p is a pointer to int
auto sz = 0, pi = 3.14; // error: inconsistent types for sz and pi
```

##### Compound Types, const, and auto

The type that the compiler infers for `auto` is not always exactly the same as the initializer‚Äôs type. Instead, the compiler adjusts the type to conform to normal initialization rules.

First, as we've seen, when we use a reference, we are really using the object to which the reference refers. In particular, when we use a reference as an initializer, the initializer is the corresponding object. The compiler uses that object's type for auto's type deduction: 
int i= 0, &r =i; 
auto a=r; // a is an int (r is an alias for i, which has type int) 
Second, auto ordinarily ignores top-level consts (¬ß 2.4.3, p. 63). As usual in initializations, low-level consts, such as when an initializer is a pointer to const, are kept: 
const int ci = i, &cr = ci; auto b=ci; // b is an int (top-level const in ci is dropped) auto c=cr; // c is an int (cr is an alias for ci whose const is top-level) auto d=&i; // d is an int*(& of an int object is int*) auto e = &ci; // e is const int*(& of a const object is low-level const) 
If we want the deduced type to have a top-level const, we must say so explicitly: 
const auto f = ci; // deduced type of ci is int; f has type const int 
We can also specify that we want a reference to the auto-deduced type. Normal initialization rules still apply: 
auto &g = ci; // g is a const int& that is bound to ci auto &h = 42; // error: we can't bind a plain reference to a literal const auto &j = 42; // ok: we can bind a const reference to a literal 
When we ask for a reference to an auto-deduced type, top-level consts in the initializer are not ignored. As usual, consts are not top-level when we bind a reference to an initializer. 
When we define several variables in the same statement, it is important to remember that a reference or pointer is part of a particular declarator and not part of the base type for the declaration. As usual, the initializers must provide consistent auto-deduced types: 
auto k=ci, &l =i; // k is int; l is int& auto &m = ci, *p = &ci; // m is a const int&;p is a pointer to const int // error: type deduced from i is int; type deduced from &ci is const int auto &n = i, *p2 = &ci; 


Exercises Section 2.5.2 
Exercise 2.33: Using the variable definitions from this section, determine what happens in each of these assignments: 
a=42; b=42; c=42; d=42; e=42; g=42; 
Exercise 2.34: Write a program containing the variables and assignments from the previous exercise. Print the variables before and after the assignments to check whether your predictions in the previous exercise were correct. If not, study the examples until you can convince yourself you know what led you to the wrong conclusion. 
Exercise 2.35: Determine the types deduced in each of the following definitions. Once you've figured out the types, write a program to see whether you were correct. 
const int i = 42; auto j = i; const auto &k = i; auto *p = &i; 
const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i; 

2.5.3. The decltype Type Specifier 

Sometimes we want to define a variable with a type that the compiler deduces from an expression but do not want to use that expression to initialize the variable. For such cases, the new standard introduced a second type specifier, decltype, which returns the type of its operand. The compiler analyzes the expression to determine its type but does not evaluate the expression: 

decltype(f()) sum = x; // sum has whatever type f returns 
Here, the compiler does not call f, but it uses the type that such a call would return as the type for sum. That is, the compiler gives sum the same type as the type that would be returned if we were to call f. 
The way decltype handles top-level const and references differs subtly from the way auto does. When the expression to which we apply decltype is a variable, decltype returns the type of that variable, including top-level const and references: 
const int ci = 0, &cj = ci; 
decltype(ci) x = 0; // x has type const int 
decltype(cj) y = x; // y has type const int& and is bound to x 
decltype(cj) z; // error: z is a reference and must be initialized 
Because cj is a reference, decltype(cj) is a reference type. Like any other reference, z must be initialized. 
It is worth noting that decltype is the only context in which a variable defined as a reference is not treated as a synonym for the object to which it refers. 
decltype and References 

When we apply decltype to an expression that is not a variable, we get the type that that expression yields. As we'll see in ¬ß 
4.1.1 
(p. 135), some expressions will cause decltype to yield a reference type. Generally speaking, decltype returns a reference type for expressions that yield objects that can stand on the left-hand side of the assignment: 
// decltype of an expression can be a reference type 
int i = 42, *p = &i, &r = i; 
decltype(r + 0) b; // ok: addition yields an int; b is an 
(uninitialized) int 
decltype(*p) c; // error: c is int& and must be initialized 
Here r is a reference, so decltype(r) is a reference type. If we want the type to which r refers, we can use r in an expression, such as r+0, which is an expression that yields a value that has a nonreference type. 
On the other hand, the dereference operator is an example of an expression for which decltype returns a reference. As we've seen, when we dereference a pointer, we get the object to which the pointer points. Moreover, we can assign to that object. Thus, the type deduced by decltype(*p) is int&, not plain int. 

Another important difference between decltype and auto is that the deduction done by decltype depends on the form of its given expression. What can be confusing is that enclosing the name of a variable in parentheses affects the type returned by decltype. When we apply decltype to a variable without any parentheses, we get the type of that variable. If we wrap the variable's name in one or more sets of parentheses, the compiler will evaluate the operand as an expression. A variable is an expression that can be the left-hand side of an assignment. As a result, decltype on such an expression yields a reference: 
// decltype of a parenthesized variable is always a reference decltype((i)) d; // error: d is int& and must be initialized decltype(i) e; // ok: e is an (uninitialized) int 



Warning 
Remember that decltype((variable)) (note, double parentheses) is always a reference type, but decltype(variable) is a reference type only if variable is a reference. 

Exercises Section 2.5.3 
Exercise 2.36: In the following code, determine the type of each variable and the value each variable has when the code finishes: 
int a= 3, b = 4; decltype(a) c = a; decltype((b)) d = a; ++c; ++d; 
Exercise 2.37: Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i=x is int&. Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code: 
int a= 3, b = 4; decltype(a) c = a; decltype(a = b) d = a; 
Exercise 2.38: Describe the differences in type deduction 
between decltype and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and decltype will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce differing types. 

2.6. Defining Our Own Data Structures 

At the most basic level, a data structure is a way to group together related data elements and a strategy for using those data. As one example, our Sales_item class groups an ISBN, a count of how many copies of that book had been sold, and the revenue associated with those sales. It also provides a set of operations such as the isbn function and the >>, <<, +, and += operators. 
In C++ we define our own data types by defining a class. The library types string, istream, and ostream are all defined as classes, as is the Sales_item type we used in Chapter 
1. C++ support for classes is extensive'in fact, Parts 
III 
and IV 
are largely devoted to describing class-related features. Even though the Sales_item class is pretty simple, we won't be able to fully define that class until we learn how to write our own operators in Chapter 
14. 

2.6.1. Defining the Sales_data Type 

Although we can't yet write our Sales_item class, we can write a more concrete class that groups the same data elements. Our strategy for using this class is that users will be able to access the data elements directly and must implement needed operations for themselves. 
Because our data structure does not support any operations, we'll name our version Sales_data to distinguish it from Sales_item. We'll define our class as follows: 
struct Sales_data { std::string bookNo; unsigned units_sold = 0; double revenue = 0.0; 
}; 
Our class begins with the keyword struct, followed by the name of the class and a (possibly empty) class body. The class body is surrounded by curly braces and forms a new scope (¬ß 2.2.4, p. 48). The names defined inside the class must be unique within the class but can reuse names defined outside the class. 
The close curly that ends the class body must be followed by a semicolon. The semicolon is needed because we can define variables after the class body: 
struct Sales_data { /* ... */ } accum, trans, *salesptr; 
// equivalent, but better way to define these objects 
struct Sales_data { /* ... */ }; 
Sales_data accum, trans, *salesptr; 
The semicolon marks the end of the (usually empty) list of declarators. Ordinarily, it is a bad idea to define an object as part of a class definition. Doing so obscures the code by combining the definitions of two different entities'the class and a variable'in a single statement. 


Warning 
It is a common mistake among new programmers to forget the semicolon at the end of a class definition. 
Class Data Members 
The class body defines the members 
of the class. Our class has only data 
members. The data members of a class define the contents of the objects of that class type. Each object has its own copy of the class data members. Modifying the data members of one object does not change the data in any other Sales_data object. 
We define data members the same way that we define normal variables: We specify a base type followed by a list of one or more declarators. Our class has three data members: a member of type string named bookNo, an unsigned member named units_sold, and a member of type double named revenue. Each Sales_data object will have these three data members. 
Under 
the 
new 
standard, 
we 
can 
supply 
an 
in-class 
initializer 
for 
a 
data 
member. 
When 
we 
create 
objects, 
the in-class initializers will be used to initialize the data members. Members without an initializer are default initialized (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43). Thus, when we define Sales_data objects, units_sold and revenue will be initialized to 0, and bookNo will be initialized to the empty string. 

In-class initializers are restricted as to the form (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 
43) we can use: They must either be enclosed inside curly braces or follow an = sign. We may not specify an in-class initializer inside parentheses. 
In ¬ß 7.2 
(p. 268), we'll see that C++ has a second keyword, class, that can be used to define our own data structures. We'll explain in that section why we use struct here. Until we cover additional class-related features in Chapter 
7, you should use struct to define your own data structures. 
Exercises Section 2.6.1 Exercise 2.39: Compile the following program to see what happens when you forget the semicolon after a class definition. Remember the message for future reference. 
struct  Foo  { /* empty  */ } // Note: no semicolon  
int  main()  
{  
return  0;  
}  
Exercise 2.40: Write your own version of the Sales_data class. 




2.6.2. Using the Sales_data Class 

Unlike the Sales_item class, our Sales_data class does not provide any operations. Users of Sales_data have to write whatever operations they need. As an example, we'll write a version of the program from ¬ß 1.5.2 
(p. 23) that printed the sum of two transactions. The input to our program will be transactions such as 
0-201-78345-X 3 20.00 
0-201-78345-X 2 25.00 
Each transaction holds an ISBN, the count of how many books were sold, and the price at which each book was sold. 
Adding Two Sales_data Objects 
Because Sales_data provides no operations, we will have to write our own code to do the input, output, and addition operations. We'll assume that our Sales_data class is defined inside Sales_data.h. We'll see how to define this header in ¬ß 2.6.3 
(p. 76). 
Because this program will be longer than any we've written so far, we'll explain it in separate parts. Overall, our program will have the following structure: 
#include <iostream> #include <string> #include "Sales_data.h" 
int  main()  
{  
Sales_data  data1, data2;  

// code to read into data1 and data2 // code to check whether data1 and data2 have the same ISBN // and if so print the sum of data1 and data2 
} 
As in our original program, we begin by including the headers we'll need and define variables to hold the input. Note that unlike the Sales_item version, our new program includes the string header. We need that header because our code will have to manage the bookNo member, which has type string. 

Reading Data into a Sales_data Object 
Although we won't describe the library string type in detail until Chapters 
3 
and 10, we need to know only a little bit about strings in order to define and use our ISBN member. The string type holds a sequence of characters. Its operations include the >>, <<, and == operators to read, write, and compare strings, respectively. With this knowledge we can write the code to read the first transaction: 
double price = 0; // price per book, used to calculate total revenue // read the first transactions: ISBN, number of books sold, price per book 
std::cin >> data1.bookNo >> data1.units_sold >> price; 
// calculate total revenue from price and units_sold 
data1.revenue = data1.units_sold * price; 
Our transactions contain the price at which each book was sold but our data structure stores the total revenue. We'll read the transaction data into a double named price, from which we'll calculate the revenue member. The input statement 
std::cin >> data1.bookNo >> data1.units_sold >> price; 
uses the dot operator (¬ß 1.5.2, p. 23) to read into the bookNo and units_sold members of the object named data1. 
The last statement assigns the product of data1.units_sold and price into the revenue member of data1. 
Our program will next repeat the same code to read data into data2: 
// read the second transaction 
std::cin >> data2.bookNo >> data2.units_sold >> price; 
data2.revenue = data2.units_sold * price; 

Printing the Sum of Two Sales_data Objects 
Our other task is to check that the transactions are for the same ISBN. If so, we'll print their sum, otherwise, we'll print an error message: 
if (data1.bookNo == data2.bookNo) { 
unsigned totalCnt = data1.units_sold + data2.units_sold; 
double totalRevenue = data1.revenue + data2.revenue; 
// print: ISBN, total sold, total revenue, average price per book 
std::cout << data1.bookNo << " " << totalCnt 
<< " " << totalRevenue << " "; 
if (totalCnt != 0) 
std::cout << totalRevenue/totalCnt << std::endl; 
else 
std::cout << "(no sales)" << std::endl; 
return 0; // indicate success 
} else { // transactions weren't for the same ISBN 
std::cerr << "Data must refer to the same ISBN" 
<< std::endl; 
return -1; // indicate failure 
} 
In the first if we compare the bookNo members of data1 and data2. If those members are the same ISBN, we execute the code inside the curly braces. That code adds the components of our two variables. Because we'll need to print the average price, we start by computing the total of units_sold and revenue and store those in totalCnt and totalRevenue, respectively. We print those values. Next we check that there were books sold and, if so, print the computed average price per book. If there were no sales, we print a message noting that fact. 

Exercises Section 2.6.2 
Exercise 2.41: Use your Sales_data class to rewrite the exercises in ¬ß 1.5.1 
(p. 22), ¬ß 1.5.2 
(p. 24), and ¬ß 1.6 

(p. 25). For now, you should define your Sales_data class in the same file as your main function. 

2.6.3. Writing Our Own Header Files 

Although as we'll see in ¬ß 19.7 
(p. 852), we can define a class inside a function, such classes have limited functionality. As a result, classes ordinarily are not defined inside functions. When we define a class outside of a function, there may be only one definition of that class in any given source file. In addition, if we use a class in several different files, the class' definition must be the same in each file. 
In order to ensure that the class definition is the same in each file, classes are usually defined in header files. Typically, classes are stored in headers whose name derives from the name of the class. For example, the string library type is defined in the string header. Similarly, as we've already seen, we will define our Sales_data class in a header file named Sales_data.h. 
Headers (usually) contain entities (such as class definitions and const and constexpr variables (¬ß 2.4, p. 60)) that can be defined only once in any given file. However, headers often need to use facilities from other headers. For example, because our Sales_data class has a string member, Sales_data.h must #include the string header. As we've seen, programs that use Sales_data also need to include the string header in order to use the bookNo member. As a result, programs that use Sales_data will include the string header twice: once directly and once as a side effect of including Sales_data.h. Because a header might be included more than once, we need to write our headers in a way that is safe even if the header is included multiple times. 


Note 
Whenever a header is updated, the source files that use that header must be recompiled to get the new or changed declarations. 
A Brief Introduction to the Preprocessor 
The most common technique for making it safe to include a header multiple times relies on the preprocessor. The preprocessor'which C++ inherits from C'is a program that runs before the compiler and changes the source text of our programs. Our programs already rely on one preprocessor facility, #include. When the preprocessor sees a #include, it replaces the #include with the contents of the specified header. 
C++ 
programs 
also 
use 
the 
preprocessor 
to 
define 
header 
guards. 
Header 
guards 
rely 
on 
preprocessor 
variables 
(¬ß 
2.3.2, 
p. 53). Preprocessor variables have one of two possible states: defined or not defined. The #define directive takes a name and defines that name as a preprocessor variable. There are two other directives that test whether a given preprocessor variable has or has not been defined: #ifdef is true if the variable has been defined, and #ifndef is true if the variable has not been defined. If the test is true, then everything following the #ifdef or #ifndef is processed up to the matching #endif. 
We can use these facilities to guard against multiple inclusion as follows: 
#ifndef SALES_DATA_H #define SALES_DATA_H #include <string> struct Sales_data { 
std::string bookNo; unsigned units_sold = 0; double revenue = 0.0; 
}; 
#endif 
The first time Sales_data.h is included, the #ifndef test will succeed. The preprocessor will process the lines following #ifndef up to the #endif. As a result, the preprocessor variable SALES_DATA_H will be defined and the contents of Sales_data.h will be copied into our program. If we include Sales_data.h later on in the same file, the #ifndef directive will be false. The lines between it and the #endif directive will be ignored. 



Warning 
Preprocessor variable names do not respect C++ scoping rules. 
Preprocessor variables, including names of header guards, must be unique throughout the program. Typically we ensure uniqueness by basing the guard's name on the name of a class in the header. To avoid name clashes with other entities in our programs, preprocessor variables usually are written in all uppercase. 


Best Practices 
Headers should have guards, even if they aren't (yet) included by another header. Header guards are trivial to write, and by habitually defining them you don't need to decide whether they are needed.

### Chapter Summary 

Types are fundamental to all programming in C++.

Each type defines the storage requirements and the operations that may be performed on objects of that type. The language provides a set of fundamental builtin types such as `int` and `char`, which are closely tied to their representation on the machine‚Äôs hardware. Types can be non`const` or `const`; a `const` object must be initialized and, once initialized, its value may not be changed. In addition, we can define compound types, such as pointers or references. A compound type is one that is defined in terms of another type.

The language lets us define our own types by defining classes. The library uses the class facility to provide a set of higher-level abstractions such as the IO and `string` types.

### Defined Terms 

**address** Number by which a byte in memory can be found.

**alias declaration** Defines a synonym for another type: using `name = type` declares name as a synonym for the type type.

**array** Data structure that holds a collection of unnamed objects that are accessed by an index. Section 3.5 covers arrays in detail.

**auto** Type specifier that deduces the type of a variable from its initializer.

**base type** type specifier, possibly qualified by `const`, that precedes the declarators in a declaration. The base type provides the common type on which the declarators in a declaration can build.

**bind** Associating a name with a given entity so that uses of the name are uses of the underlying entity. For example, a reference is a name that is bound to an object.

**byte** Smallest addressable unit of memory. On most machines a byte is 8 bits.

**class member** Part of a class.

**compound type** A type that is defined in terms of another type.

**const** Type qualifier used to define objects that may not be changed. const objects must be initialized, because there is no way to give them a value after they are defined.

**const pointer** Pointer that is const.

**const reference** Colloquial synonym for reference to const.

**constant expression** Expression that can be evaluated at compile time.

**constexpr** Variable that represents a constant expression. ¬ß 6.5.2 (p. 239) covers `constexpr` functions.

**conversion** Process whereby a value of one type is transformed into a value of another type. The language defines conversions among the built-in types.

**data member** Data elements that constitute an object. Every object of a given class has its own copies of the class‚Äô data members. Data members may be initialized when declared inside the class.

**declaration** Asserts the existence of a variable, function, or type defined elsewhere. Names may not be used until they are defined or declared.

uninitialized 
Variable defined without an initial value. In 
general, trying to access the value of an uninitialized variable results in undefined behavior. 
unsigned 
Integer type that holds only values greater than or equal to zero.

void* 
Pointer type that can point to any nonconst type. Such pointers may not be dereferenced. 
void type Special-purpose type that has no operations and no value. It is not possible to define a variable of type void.

& 
operator 
Address-of operator. Yields the address of the object to which it is applied. 

* operator 
Dereference operator. Dereferencing a pointer returns the object to which the pointer points. Assigning to the result of a dereference assigns a new value to the underlying object.

`# ifdef` Preprocessor directive that determines whether a given variable is defined. 
`# ifndef` Preprocessor directive that determines whether a given variable is not defined. 

## Chapter 3. Strings, Vectors, and Arrays 

In addition to the built-in types covered in Chapter 2, C++ defines a rich library of abstract data types. Among the most important library types are string, which supports variable-length character strings, and vector, which defines variable-size collections. Associated with string and vector are companion types known as iterators, which are used to access the characters in a string or the elements in a vector. 
The string and vector types defined by the library are abstractions of the more primitive built-in array type. This chapter covers arrays and introduces the library vector and string types. 
The built-in types that we covered in Chapter 2 are defined directly by the C++ language. These types represent facilities present in most computer hardware, such as numbers or characters. The standard library defines a number of additional types of a higher-level nature that computer hardware usually does not implement directly. 
In this chapter, we'll introduce two of the most important library types: string and vector.A string is a variable-length sequence of characters. A vector holds a variable-length sequence of objects of a given type. We'll also cover the built-in array type. Like other built-in types, arrays represent facilities of the hardware. As a result, arrays are less convenient to use than the library string and vector types. 
Before beginning our exploration of the library types, we'll look at a mechanism for simplifying access to the names defined in the library. 

### 3.1. Namespace using Declarations 

Up to now, our programs have explicitly indicated that each library name we use is in the std namespace. For example, to read from the standard input, we write std::cin. These names use the scope operator (::) (¬ß 1.2, p. 8), which says that the compiler should look in the scope of the left-hand operand for the name of the right-hand operand. Thus, std::cin says that we want to use the name cin from the namespace std. 
Referring to library names with this notation can be cumbersome. Fortunately, there are easier ways to use namespace members. The safest way is a using 
declaration.¬ß 
18.2.2 
(p. 793) covers another way to use names from a namespace. 
A using declaration lets us use a name from a namespace without qualifying the name with a namespace_name:: prefix. A using declaration has the form 
using namespace::name; 
Once the using declaration has been made, we can access name directly: 

`include <iostream> // using declaration; when we use the name cin, we get the one from the`

namespace std  
using std::cin;  
int main()  
{  
int i;  
cin >> i;  // ok: cin is a synonym for std::cin  
cout << i;  // error: no using declaration; we must use the full  
name  

std::cout << i; // ok: explicitly use cout from namepsace std return 0; 
} 

A Separate using Declaration Is Required for Each Name 
Each using declaration introduces a single namespace member. This behavior lets us be specific about which names we're using. As an example, we'll rewrite the program from ¬ß 1.2 
(p. 
6) with using declarations for the library names it uses: 
#include <iostream> // using declarations for names from the standard library 
using std::cin; 
using std::cout; using std::endl; 
int main() 
{ 
cout << "Enter two numbers:" << endl; 
int v1, v2; 
cin >> v1 >> v2; 
cout << "The sum of "<< v1 << "and " << v2 
<< "is "<< v1 +v2 << endl; 
return 0; 
} The using declarations for cin, cout, and endl mean that we can use those names without the std:: prefix. Recall that C++ programs are free-form, so we can put each using declaration on its own line or combine several onto a single line. The important part is that there must be a using declaration for each name we use, and each declaration must end in a semicolon. 
Headers Should Not Include using Declarations 
Code inside headers (¬ß 2.6.3, p. 76) ordinarily should not use using declarations. The reason is that the contents of a header are copied into the including program's text. If a header has a using declaration, then every program that includes that header gets that same using declaration. As a result, a program that didn't intend to use the specified library name might encounter unexpected name conflicts. 

A Note to the Reader 
From this point on, our examples will assume that using declarations have been made for the names we use from the standard library. Thus, we will refer to cin, not std::cin, in the text and in code examples. 
Moreover, to keep the code examples short, we won't show the using declarations, nor will we show the necessary #include directives. Table 
A.1 
(p. 866) in Appendix 
A 
lists the names and corresponding headers for standard library names we use in this Primer. 


Warning 
Readers should be aware that they must add appropriate #include and using declarations to our examples before compiling them. 
Exercises Section 3.1 Exercise 3.1: Rewrite the exercises from ¬ß 1.4.1 
(p. 
13) and ¬ß 2.6.2 
(p. 76) with appropriate using declarations. 

3.2. Library string Type 

A string 
is a variable-length sequence of characters. To use the string type, we must include the string header. Because it is part of the library, string is defined in the std namespace. Our examples assume the following code: 
#include <string> 
using std::string; 
This section describes the most common string operations; ¬ß 
9.5 
(p. 360) will cover additional operations. 

Note 
In addition to specifying the operations that the library types provide, the standard also imposes efficiency requirements on implementors. As a result, library types are efficient enough for general use. 
3.2.1. Defining and Initializing strings 

Each class defines how objects of its type can be initialized. A class may define many different ways to initialize objects of its type. Each way must be distinguished from the others either by the number of initializers that we supply, or by the types of those initializers. Table 
3.1 
lists the most common ways to initialize strings. Some examples: 
string s1; // default initialization; s1 is the empty string string s2 = s1; // s2isacopyof s1 string s3 = "hiya"; // s3 is a copy of the string literal 
string s4(10, 'c'); // s4 is cccccccccc 

We can default initialize a string (' 2.2.1, p. 44), which creates an empty string; that is, a string with no characters. When we supply a string literal (' 2.1.3, p. 39), the characters from that literal'up to but not including the null character at the end of the literal'are copied into the newly created string. When we supply a count and a character, the string contains that many copies of the given character. 
Direct and Copy Forms of Initialization 
In ' 2.2.1 
(p. 43) we saw that C++ has several different forms of initialization. Using strings, we can start to understand how these forms differ from one another. When we initialize a variable using =, we are asking the compiler to copy 
initialize 
the object by copying the initializer on the right-hand side into the object being created. Otherwise, when we omit the =, we use direct 
initialization. 
When we have a single initializer, we can use either the direct or copy form of initialization. When we initialize a variable from more than one value, such as in the initialization of s4 above, we must use the direct form of initialization: 
string s5 = "hiya"; // copy initialization 
string s6("hiya"); // direct initialization 
string s7(10, 'c'); // direct initialization; s7 is cccccccccc 
When we want to use several values, we can indirectly use the copy form of initialization by explicitly creating a (temporary) object to copy: 
string s8 = string(10, 'c'); // copy initialization; s8 is cccccccccc 
The initializer of s8'string(10, 'c')'creates a string of the given size and character value and then copies that value into s8. It is as if we had written 
string temp(10, 'c'); // temp is cccccccccc string s8 = temp; // copy temp into s8 
Although the code used to initialize s8 is legal, it is less readable and offers no compensating advantage over the way we initialized s7. 
3.2.2. Operations on strings 

Along with defining how objects are created and initialized, a class also defines the operations that objects of the class type can perform. A class can define operations that are called by name, such as the isbn function of our Sales_item class (' 1.5.2, 
p. 23). A class also can define what various operator symbols, such as << or +, mean when applied to objects of the class' type. Table 
3.2 
(overleaf) lists the most common string operations. 

Reading and Writing strings 
As we saw in Chapter 
1, we use the iostream library to read and write values of built-in types such as int, double, and so on. We use the same IO operators to read and write strings: 
// Note: #include and using declarations must be added to compile this code 
int main() 
{ string s; // empty string cin >> s; // read a whitespace-separated string into s cout << s << endl; // write s to the output return 0; 
} 
This program begins by defining an empty string named s. The next line reads the standard input, storing what is read in s. The string input operator reads and discards any leading whitespace (e.g., spaces, newlines, tabs). It then reads characters until the next whitespace character is encountered. 
So, if the input to this program is Hello World! (note leading and trailing spaces), then the output will be Hello with no extra spaces. 
Like the input and output operations on the built-in types, the string operators return their left-hand operand as their result. Thus, we can chain together multiple reads or writes: 
string s1, s2; 
cin >> s1 >> s2; // read first input into s1, second into s2 
cout << s1 << s2 << endl; // write both strings 
If we give this version of the program the same input, Hello World!, our output would be 'HelloWorld!' 
Reading an Unknown Number of strings 
In ' 1.4.3 
(p. 14) we wrote a program that read an unknown number of int values. We can write a similar program that reads strings instead: 
int main() 
{ 
string word; 
while (cin >> word) // read until end-of-file 
cout << word << endl; // write each word followed by a new 
line 
return 0; } 
In this program, we read into a string, not an int. Otherwise, the while condition executes similarly to the one in our previous program. The condition tests the stream after the read completes. If the stream is valid'it hasn't hit end-of-file or encountered an invalid input'then the body of the while is executed. The body prints the value we read on the standard output. Once we hit end-of-file (or invalid input), we fall out of the while. 
Using getline to Read an Entire Line 
Sometimes we do not want to ignore the whitespace in our input. In such cases, we can use the getline 
function instead of the >> operator. The getline function takes an input stream and a string. This function reads the given stream up to and including the first newline and stores what it read'not including the newline'in its string argument. After getline sees a newline, even if it is the first character in the input, it stops reading and returns. If the first character in the input is a newline, then the resulting string is the empty string. 
Like the input operator, getline returns its istream argument. As a result, we can use getline as a condition just as we can use the input operator as a condition (¬ß 1.4.3, p. 14). For example, we can rewrite the previous program that wrote one word per line to write a line at a time instead: 
int main() 
{ string line; // read input a line at a time until end-of-file while (getline(cin, line)) 
cout << line << endl; return 0; } 
Because line does not contain a newline, we must write our own. As usual, we use endl to end the current line and flush the buffer. 

Note 
The newline that causes getline to return is discarded; the newline is not stored in the string. 
The string empty and size Operations 
The empty 
function does what one would expect: It returns a bool (¬ß 2.1, p. 32) indicating whether the string is empty. Like the isbn member of Sales_item (¬ß 1.5.2, p. 23), empty is a member function of string. To call this function, we use the dot operator to specify the object on which we want to run the empty function. 
We can revise the previous program to only print lines that are not empty: 
// read input a line at a time and discard blank lines while (getline(cin, line)) if (!line.empty()) cout << line << endl; 
The condition uses the logical NOT operator (the ! 
operator). This operator returns the inverse of the bool value of its operand. In this case, the condition is true if str is not empty. 
The size 
member returns the length of a string (i.e., the number of characters in it). We can use size to print only lines longer than 80 characters: 
string line; // read input a line at a time and print lines that are longer than 80 characters 
while (getline(cin, line)) if (line.size() > 80) cout << line << endl; 
The string::size_type Type 
It might be logical to expect that size returns an int or, thinking back to ¬ß 2.1.1 
(p. 34), an unsigned. Instead, size returns a string::size_type value. This type requires a bit of explanation. 
The string class'and most other library types'defines several companion types. These companion types make it possible to use the library types in a machine-independent manner. The type size_type 
is one of these companion types. To use the size_type defined by string, we use the scope operator to say that the name size_type is defined in the string class. 
Although we don't know the precise type of string::size_type, we do know that it is an unsigned type (¬ß 2.1.1, p. 32) big enough to hold the size of any string. Any variable used to store the result from the string size operation should be of type string::size_type. 

Admittedly, it can be tedious to type string::size_type. Under the new standard, we can ask the compiler to provide the appropriate type by using auto or decltype (¬ß 2.5.2, p. 68): 
auto len = line.size(); // len has type string::size_type 
Because size returns an unsigned type, it is essential to remember that expressions that mix signed and unsigned data can have surprising results (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 36). For example, if n is an int that holds a negative value, then s.size() < n will almost surely evaluate as true. It yields true because the negative value in n will convert to a large unsigned value. 

Tip 
You can avoid problems due to conversion between unsigned and int by not using ints in expressions that use size(). 
Comparing strings 
The string class defines several operators that compare strings. These operators work by comparing the characters of the strings. The comparisons are case-sensitive'upper-and lowercase versions of a letter are different characters. 
The equality operators (== and !=) test whether two strings are equal or unequal, respectively. Two strings are equal if they are the same length and contain the same characters. The relational operators <, <=, >, >= test whether one string is less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to another. These operators use the same strategy as a (case-sensitive) dictionary: 
1. 
If two strings have different lengths and if every character in the shorter string is equal to the corresponding character of the longer string, then the shorter string is less than the longer one. 

2. 
If any characters at corresponding positions in the two strings differ, then the result of the string comparison is the result of comparing the first character at which the strings differ. 


As an example, consider the following strings: 
string str = "Hello"; 
string phrase = "Hello World"; 
string slang = "Hiya"; 
Using rule 1, we see that str is less than phrase. By applying rule 2, we see that slang is greater than both str and phrase. 
Assignment for strings 
In general, the library types strive to make it as easy to use a library type as it is to use a built-in type. To this end, most of the library types support assignment. In the case of strings, we can assign one string object to another: 
string st1(10, 'c'), st2; // st1 is cccccccccc; st2 is an empty 
string 
st1 = st2; // assignment: replace contents of st1 with a copy of st2 
// both st1 and st2 are now the empty string 
Adding Two strings 
Adding two strings yields a new string that is the concatenation of the left-hand followed by the right-hand operand. That is, when we use the plus operator (+) on strings, the result is a new string whose characters are a copy of those in the left-hand operand followed by those from the right-hand operand. The compound assignment operator (+=) (¬ß 1.4.1, p. 12) appends the right-hand operand to the left-hand string: 
string s1 = "hello, ", s2 = "world\n"; 
string s3 = s1 + s2; // s3 is hello, world\n 
s1 += s2; // equivalent to s1 = s1 + s2 
Adding Literals and strings 
As we saw in ¬ß 2.1.2 
(p. 35), we can use one type where 
another type is expected if there is a conversion from the given type to the expected type. The string library lets us convert both character literals and character string literals (¬ß 2.1.3, p. 
39) to strings. Because we can use these literals where a string is expected, we can rewrite the previous program as follows: 
string s1 = "hello", s2 = "world"; // no punctuation in s1 or s2 
string s3 =s1 +", "+s2 + '\n'; 
When we mix strings and string or character literals, at least one operand to each + operator must be of string type: 
string s4 =s1 +", "; // ok: adding a string and a literal string s5 = "hello" + ", "; // error: no string operand string s6 = s1 + ", " + "world"; // ok: each + has a string operand string s7 = "hello" + ", " + s2; // error: can't add string literals 
The initializations of s4 and s5 involve only a single operation each, so it is easy to see whether the initialization is legal. The initialization of s6 may appear surprising, but it works in much the same way as when we chain together input or output expressions (¬ß 1.2, p. 7). This initialization groups as 
string s6 = (s1 + ", ") + "world"; 
The subexpression s1 +", " returns a string, which forms the left-hand operand of the second + operator. It is as if we had written 
string tmp =s1 +", "; // ok: + has a string operand 
s6 = tmp + "world"; // ok: + has a string operand 
On the other hand, the initialization of s7 is illegal, which we can see if we parenthesize the expression: 
string s7 = ("hello" + ", ") + s2; // error: can't add string literals 
Now it should be easy to see that the first subexpression adds two string literals. There is no way to do so, and so the statement is in error. 

Warning 
For historical reasons, and for compatibility with C, string literals are not standard library strings. It is important to remember that these types differ when you use string literals and library strings. 
Exercises Section 3.2.2 Exercise 3.2: Write a program to read the standard 
input a line at a time. Modify your program to read a word at a time. Exercise 3.3: Explain how whitespace characters are 
handled in the string input operator and in the getline 
function. Exercise 3.4: Write a program to read two strings and report whether the strings are equal. If not, report which of the two is larger. Now, change the program to report whether the strings have the same length, and if not, report which is longer. 
Exercise 3.5: Write a program to read strings from the standard input, concatenating what is read into one large string. Print the concatenated string. Next, change the program to separate adjacent input strings by a space. 
3.2.3. Dealing with the Characters in a string 

Often we need to deal with the individual characters in a string. We might want to check to see whether a string contains any whitespace, or to change the characters to lowercase, or to see whether a given character is present, and so on. 
One part of this kind of processing involves how we gain access to the characters themselves. Sometimes we need to process every character. Other times we need to process only a specific character, or we can stop processing once some condition is met. It turns out that the best way to deal with these cases involves different language and library facilities. 
The other part of processing characters is knowing and/or changing the characteristics of a character. This part of the job is handled by a set of library functions, described in Table 
3.3 
(overleaf). These functions are defined in the cctype header. 

Advice: Use the C++ Versions of C Library Headers 
In addition to facilities defined specifically for C++, the C++ library incorporates the C library. Headers in C have names of the form name .h. The C++ versions of these headers are named c name'they remove the .h suffix and precede the name with the letter c. The c indicates that the header is part of the C library. 
Hence, cctype has the same contents as ctype.h, but in a form that is appropriate for C++ programs. In particular, the names defined in the cname headers are defined inside the std namespace, whereas those defined in the .h versions are not. 
Ordinarily, C++ programs should use the cname versions of headers and not the name .h versions. That way names from the standard library are consistently found in the std namespace. Using the .h headers puts the burden on the programmer to remember which library names are inherited from C and which are unique to C++. 

Processing Every Character? Use Range-Based for 
If we want to do something to every character in a string, by far the best approach is to use a statement introduced by the new standard: the range 
for 
statement. This statement iterates through the elements in a given sequence and performs some operation on each value in that sequence. The syntactic form is 
for (declaration : expression) statement 
where expression is an object of a type that represents a sequence, and declaration defines the variable that we'll use to access the underlying elements in the sequence. On each iteration, the variable in declaration is initialized from the value of the next element in expression. 
A string represents a sequence of characters, so we can use a string as the expression in a range for. As a simple example, we can use a range for to print each character from a string on its own line of output: 
string str("some string"); 
// print the characters in str one character to a line 
for (auto c : str) // for every char in str 
cout << c << endl; // print the current character followed by a 
newline 
The for loop associates the variable c with str. We define the loop control variable the same way we do any other variable. In this case, we use auto (¬ß 2.5.2, p. 68) to let the compiler determine the type of c, which in this case will be char. On each iteration, the next character in str will be copied into c. Thus, we can read this loop as saying, 'For every character c in the string str,¬ß do something. The 'something' in this case is to print the character followed by a newline. 
As a somewhat more complicated example, we'll use a range for and the ispunct function to count the number of punctuation characters in a string: 
string s("Hello World!!!"); 
// punct_cnt has the same type that s.size returns; see ¬ß 2.5.3 (p. 70) 
decltype(s.size()) punct_cnt = 0; 
// count the number of punctuation characters in s 
for (auto c:s) // for every char in s 
if (ispunct(c)) // if the character is punctuation ++punct_cnt; // increment the punctuation counter cout << punct_cnt << " punctuation characters in " << s << endl; 
The output of this program is 
3 punctuation characters in Hello World!!! 
Here we use decltype (¬ß 2.5.3, p. 70) to declare our counter, punct_cnt. Its type is the type returned by calling s.size, which is string::size_type. We use a range for to process each character in the string. This time we check whether each character is punctuation. If so, we use the increment operator (¬ß 1.4.1, p. 12) to add 1 to the counter. When the range for completes, we print the result. 
Using a Range for to Change the Characters in a string 
If we want to change the value of the characters in a string, we must define the loop variable as a reference type (¬ß 2.3.1, p. 50). Remember that a reference is just another name for a given object. When we use a reference as our control variable, that variable is bound to each element in the sequence in turn. Using the reference, we can change the character to which the reference is bound. 
Suppose that instead of counting punctuation, we wanted to convert a string to all uppercase letters. To do so we can use the library toupper function, which takes a character and returns the uppercase version of that character. To convert the whole string we need to call toupper on each character and put the result back in that character: 
string s("Hello World!!!"); 
// convert s to uppercase 
for (auto &c : s) // for every char in s (note: c is a reference) 
c = toupper(c); // c is a reference, so the assignment changes the 
char in s 
cout << s << endl; The output of this code is 
HELLO WORLD!!! 
On each iteration, c refers to the next character in s. When we assign to c, we are changing the underlying character in s. So, when we execute 
c = toupper(c); // c is a reference, so the assignment changes the char in s 
we're changing the value of the character to which c is bound. When this loop completes, all the characters in str will be uppercase. 
Processing Only Some Characters? 
A range for works well when we need to process every character. However, sometimes we need to access only a single character or to access characters until some condition is reached. For example, we might want to capitalize only the first character or only the first word in a string. 
There are two ways to access individual characters in a string: We can use a subscript or an iterator. We'll have more to say about iterators in ¬ß 3.4 
(p. 106) and in Chapter 
9. 
The subscript operator (the [] 
operator) takes a string::size_type (¬ß 3.2.2, p. 88) value that denotes the position of the character we want to access. The operator returns a reference to the character at the given position. 
Subscripts for strings start at zero; if s is a string with at least two characters, then s[0] is the first character, s[1] is the second, and the last character is in s[s.size() -1]. 

Note 
The values we use to subscript a string must be >= 0 and < size(). 
The result of using an index outside this range is 
undefined. By implication, subscripting an empty string is undefined. 
The value in the subscript is referred to as 'a subscript' or 'an index.¬ß The index we supply can be any expression that yields an integral value. However, if our index has a signed type, its value will be converted to the unsigned type that string::size_type represents (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 36). 
The following example uses the subscript operator to print the first character in a string: 
if (!s.empty()) // make sure there's a character to print cout << s[0] << endl; // print the first character in s 
Before accessing the character, we check that s is not empty. Any time we use a subscript, we must ensure that there is a value at the given location. If s is empty, then s[0] is undefined. 
So long as the string is not const (¬ß 2.4, p. 59), we can assign a new value to the character that the subscript operator returns. For example, we can capitalize the first letter as follows: 
string s("some string"); if (!s.empty()) // make sure there's a character in s[0] s[0] = toupper(s[0]); // assign a new value to the first character in s 
The output of this program is 
Some string 
Using a Subscript for Iteration 
As a another example, we'll change the first word in s to all uppercase: 
// process characters in s until we run out of characters or we hit a whitespace 
for (decltype(s.size()) index = 0; index != s.size() && !isspace(s[index]); ++index) s[index] = toupper(s[index]); // capitalize the current 
character 
This program generates 
SOME string 
Our for loop (¬ß 1.4.2, p. 13) uses index to subscript s. We use decltype to give index the appropriate type. We initialize index to 0 so that the first iteration will start on the first character in s. On each iteration we increment index to look at the next character in s. In the body of the loop we capitalize the current letter. 
The new part in this loop is the condition in the for. That condition uses the logical AND operator (the && 
operator). This operator yields true if both operands are true and false otherwise. The important part about this operator is that we are guaranteed that it evaluates its right-hand operand only if the left-hand operand is true. In this case, we are guaranteed that we will not subscript s unless we know that index is in range. That is, s[index] is executed only if index is not equal to s.size(). Because index is never incremented beyond the value of s.size(), we know that index will always be less than s.size(). 
Caution: Subscripts are Unchecked When we use a subscript, we must ensure that the subscript is in range. That is, the subscript must be >= 0 and < the size() of the string. One way to simplify code that uses subscripts is always to use a variable of type string::size_type as the subscript. Because that type is unsigned, we ensure that the subscript cannot be less than zero. When we use a size_type value as the subscript, we need to check only that our subscript is less than value returned by size(). 

Warning 
The library is not required to check the value of an subscript. The result of using an out-of-range subscript is undefined. 

Using a Subscript for Random Access 
In the previous example we advanced our subscript one position at a time to capitalize each character in sequence. We can also calculate an subscript and directly fetch the indicated character. There is no need to access characters in sequence. 
As an example, let's assume we have a number between 0 and 15 and we want to generate the hexadecimal representation of that number. We can do so using a string that is initialized to hold the 16 hexadecimal 'digits': 
const string hexdigits = "0123456789ABCDEF"; // possible hex digits 
cout << "Enter a series of numbers between 0 and 15" << " separated by spaces. Hit ENTER when finished: " << endl; 
string result; // will hold the resulting hexify'd string string::size_type n; // hold numbers from the input while (cin >> n) 
if (n < hexdigits.size()) // ignore invalid input result += hexdigits[n]; // fetch the indicated hex digit cout << "Your hex number is: " << result << endl; 
If we give this program the input 
12 0 5 15 8 15 
the output will be 
Your hex number is: C05F8F 
We start by initializing hexdigits to hold the hexadecimal digits 0 through F. We make that string const (¬ß 2.4, p. 59) because we do not want these values to change. Inside the loop we use the input value n to subscript hexdigits. The value of hexdigits[n] is the char that appears at position n in hexdigits. For example, if n is 15, then the result is F; if it's 12, the result is C; and so on. We append that digit to result, which we print once we have read all the input. 
Whenever we use a subscript, we should think about how we know that it is in range. In this program, our subscript, n, is a string::size_type, which as we know is an unsigned type. As a result, we know that n is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 0. Before we use n to subscript hexdigits, we verify that it is less than the size of hexdigits.

3.3. Library vector Type 

A vector 
is a collection of objects, all of which have the same type. Every object in the collection has an associated index, which gives access to that object. A vector is often referred to as a container 
because it 'contains' other objects. We'll have much more to say about containers in Part 
II. 
To use a vector, we must include the appropriate header. In our examples, we also assume that an appropriate using declaration is made: 
#include <vector> using std::vector; 
A vector is a class 
template. C++ has both class and function templates. Writing a template requires a fairly deep understanding of C++. Indeed, we won't see how to create our own templates until Chapter 
16! Fortunately, we can use templates without knowing how to write them. 
Templates are not themselves functions or classes. Instead, they can be thought of as instructions to the compiler for generating classes or functions. The process that the compiler uses to create classes or functions from templates is called instantiation. When we use a template, we specify what kind of class or function we want the compiler to instantiate. 
For a class template, we specify which class to instantiate by supplying additional information, the nature of which depends on the template. How we specify the information is always the same: We supply it inside a pair of angle brackets following the template's name. 
In the case of vector, the additional information we supply is the type of the objects the vector will hold: 
vector<int> ivec; // ivec holds objects of type int vector<Sales_item> Sales_vec; // holds Sales_items vector<vector<string>> file; // vector whose elements are vectors 
In this example, the compiler generates three distinct types from the vector template: vector<int>, vector<Sales_item>, and vector<vector<string>>. 

Note 
vector is a template, not a type. Types generated from vector must include the element type, for example, vector<int>. 
We can define vectors to hold objects of most any type. Because references are not objects (¬ß 2.3.1, p. 50), we cannot have a vector of references. However, we can have vectors of most other (nonreference) built-in types and most class types. In particular, we can have vectors whose elements are themselves vectors. 

It is worth noting that earlier versions of C++ used a slightly different syntax to define a vector whose elements are themselves vectors (or another template type). In the past, we had to supply a space between the closing angle bracket of the outer vector and its element type'vector<vector<int> > rather than vector<vector<int>>. 

Warning 
Some compilers may require the old-style declarations for a vector of vectors, for example, vector<vector<int> >. 
3.3.1. Defining and Initializing vectors 

As with any class type, the vector template controls how we define and initialize vectors. Table 
3.4 
(p. 99) lists the most common ways to define vectors. 

We can default initialize a vector (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 44), which creates an empty vector of the specified type: 
vector<string> svec; // default initialization; svec has no elements 
It might seem that an empty vector would be of little use. However, as we'll see shortly, we can (efficiently) add elements to a vector at run time. Indeed, the most common way of using vectors is to define an initially empty vector to which elements are added as their values become known at run time. 
We can also supply initial value(s) for the element(s) when we define a vector. For example, we can copy elements from another vector. When we copy a vector, each element in the new vector is a copy of the corresponding element in the original vector. The two vectors must be the same type: 
vector<int> ivec; // initially empty 
// give ivec some values 
vector<int> ivec2(ivec); // copy elements of ivec into ivec2 vector<int> ivec3 = ivec; // copy elements of ivec into ivec3 vector<string> svec(ivec2); // error: svec holds strings, not ints 

List Initializing a vector 

Another way to provide element values, is that under the new standard, we can list initialize (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43) a vector from a list of zero or more initial element values enclosed in curly braces: 
vector<string> articles = {"a", "an", "the"}; 
The resulting vector has three elements; the first holds the string "a", the second holds "an", and the last is "the". 
As we've seen, C++ provides several forms of initialization (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43). In many, but not all, cases we can use these forms of initialization interchangably. So far, we have seen two examples where the form of initialization matters: when we use the copy initialization form (i.e., when we use =) (¬ß 3.2.1, p. 84), we can supply only a single initializer; and when we supply an in-class initializer (¬ß 2.6.1, p. 73), we must either use copy initialization or use curly braces. A third restriction is that we can supply a list of element values only by using list initialization in which the initializers are enclosed in curly braces. We cannot supply a list of initializers using parentheses: 
vector<string> v1{"a", "an", "the"}; // list initialization 
vector<string> v2("a", "an", "the"); // error 

Creating a Specified Number of Elements 
We can also initialize a vector from a count and an element value. The count determines how many elements the vector will have; the value provides the initial value for each of those elements: 
vector<int> ivec(10, -1); // ten int elements, each initialized to -1 vector<string> svec(10, "hi!"); // ten strings; each element is "hi!" 

Value Initialization 
We can usually omit the value and supply only a size. In this case the library creates a value-initialized 
element initializer for us. This library-generated value is used to initialize each element in the container. The value of the element initializer depends on the type of the elements stored in the vector. 
If the vector holds elements of a built-in type, such as int, then the element initializer has a value of 0. If the elements are of a class type, such as string, then the element initializer is itself default initialized: 
vector<int> ivec(10); // ten elements, each initialized to 0 
vector<string> svec(10); // ten elements, each an empty string 
There are two restrictions on this form of initialization: The first restriction is that some classes require that we always supply an explicit initializer (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 44). If our vector holds objects of a type that we cannot default initialize, then we must supply an initial element value; it is not possible to create vectors of such types by supplying only a size. 
The second restriction is that when we supply an element count without also supplying an initial value, we must use the direct form of initialization: 
vector<int> vi = 10; // error: must use direct initialization to supply a size 
Here we are using 10 to instruct vector how to create the vector 'we want a vector with ten value-initialized elements. We are not 'copying' 10 into the vector. Hence, we cannot use the copy form of initialization. We'll see more about how this restriction 
works in ¬ß 7.5.4 
(p. 296). 

List Initializer or Element Count? 

In a few cases, what initialization means depends upon whether we use curly braces or parentheses to pass the initializer(s). For example, when we initialize a vector<int> from a single int value, that value might represent the vector's size or it might be an element value. Similarly, if we supply exactly two int values, those values could be a size and an initial value, or they could be values for a two-element vector. We specify which meaning we intend by whether we use curly braces or parentheses: 
vector<int> v1(10); // v1 has ten elements with value 0 vector<int> v2{10}; // v2 has one element with value 10 vector<int> v3(10, 1); // v3 has ten elements with value 1 vector<int> v4{10, 1}; // v4 has two elements with values 10 and 1 
When we use parentheses, we are saying that the values we supply are to be used to construct the object. Thus, v1 and v3 use their initializers to determine the vector's size, and its size and element values, respectively. 
When we use curly braces, {...}, we're saying that, if possible, we want to list initialize the object. That is, if there is a way to use the values inside the curly braces as a list of element initializers, the class will do so. Only if it is not possible to list initialize the object will the other ways to initialize the object be considered. The values we supply when we initialize v2 and v4 can be used as element values. These objects are list initialized; the resulting vectors have one and two elements, respectively. 
On the other hand, if we use braces and there is no way to use the initializers to list initialize the object, then those values will be used to construct the object. For example, to list initialize a vector of strings, we must supply values that can be used as strings. In this case, there is no confusion about whether to list initialize the elements or construct a vector of the given size: 
vector<string> v5{"hi"}; // list initialization: v5 has one element vector<string> v6("hi"); // error: can't construct a vector from a string literal vector<string> v7{10}; // v7 has ten default-initialized elements vector<string> v8{10, "hi"}; // v8 has ten elements with value "hi" 
Although we used braces on all but one of these definitions, only v5 is list initialized. In order to list initialize the vector, the values inside braces must match the element type. We cannot use an int to initialize a string, so the initializers for v7 and v8 can't be element initializers. If list initialization isn't possible, the compiler looks for other ways to initialize the object from the given values. 
Exercises Section 3.3.1 Exercise 3.12: Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal. 
(a)

(b) 
vector<string> svec = ivec; 

(c) 
vector<string> svec(10, "null"); 


Exercise 3.13: How many elements are there in each of the following vectors? What are the values of the elements? 
(a) vector<int> v1; (b) vector<int> v2(10); (c) vector<int> v3(10, 42); (d) vector<int> v4{10}; (e) vector<int> v5{10, 42}; (f) vector<string> v6{10}; 
(g) vector<string> v7{10, "hi"}; 
3.3.2. Adding Elements to a vector 

Directly initializing the elements of a vector is feasible only if we have a small number of known initial values, if we want to make a copy of another vector, or if we want to initialize all the elements to the same value. More commonly, when we create a vector, we don't know how many elements we'll need, or we don't know the value of those elements. Even if we do know all the values, if we have a large number of different initial element values, it can be cumbersome to specify them when we create the vector. 
As one example, if we need a vector with values from 0 to 9, we can easily use list initialization. What if we wanted elements from 0 to 99 or 0 to 999? List initialization would be too unwieldy. In such cases, it is better to create an empty vector and use a vector member named push_back 
to add elements at run time. The push_back operation takes a value and 'pushes' that value as a new last element onto the 'back' of the vector. For example: 
vector<int> v2; // empty vector 
for (int i = 0; i != 100; ++i) v2.push_back(i); // append sequential integers to v2 // at end of loop v2 has 100 elements, values 0 . . . 99 Even though we know we ultimately will have 100 elements, we 
define v2 as empty. Each iteration adds the next sequential integer as a new element in v2. 
We use the same approach when we want to create a vector where we don't know until run time how many elements the vector should have. For example, we might read the input, storing the values we read in the vector: 
// read words from the standard input and store them as elements in a vector 
string word; vector<string> text; // empty vector while (cin >> word) { 
text.push_back(word); // append word to text } 
Again, we start with an initially empty vector. This time, we read and store an unknown number of values in text. 
Key Concept: vectors Grow Efficiently The standard requires that vector implementations can efficiently add elements at run time. Because vectors grow efficiently, it is often unnecessary'and can result in poorer performance'to define a vector of a specific size. The exception to this rule is if all the elements actually need the same value. If differing element values are needed, it is usually more efficient to define an empty vector and add elements as the values we need become known at run time. Moreover, as we'll see in ¬ß 9.4 
(p. 355), vector offers capabilities to allow us to further enhance run-time performance when we add elements. 
Starting with an empty vector and adding elements at run time is distinctly different from how we use built-in arrays in C and in most other languages. In particular, if you are accustomed to using C or Java, you might expect that it would be best to define the vector at its 
expected size. In fact, the contrary is usually the case. 

Programming Implications of Adding Elements to a vector 
The fact that we can easily and efficiently add elements to a vector greatly simplifies many programming tasks. However, this simplicity imposes a new obligation on our programs: We must ensure that any loops we write are correct even if the loop changes the size of the vector. 
Other implications that follow from the dynamic nature of vectors will become clearer as we learn more about using them. However, there is one implication that is worth noting already: For reasons we'll explore in ¬ß 5.4.3 
(p. 188), we cannot use a range for if the body of the loop adds elements to the vector. 

Warning 
The body of a range for must not change the size of the sequence over which it is iterating. 
Exercises Section 3.3.2 
Exercise 3.14: Write a program to read a sequence of ints from cin and store those values in a vector. Exercise 3.15: Repeat the previous program but read 
strings this time. 
3.3.3. Other vector Operations 

In addition to push_back, vector provides only a few other 
operations, most of which are similar to the corresponding operations on strings. Table 
3.5 
lists the most important ones. 

We access the elements of a vector the same way that we access the characters in a string: through their position in the vector. For example, we can use a range for (¬ß 3.2.3, p. 91) to process all the elements in a vector: 
vector<int> v{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; for (auto &i : v) // for each element in v (note: i is a reference) i *= i; // square the element value for (auto i:v) // for each element in v cout << i<< " ";// print the element 
cout << endl; In the first loop, we define our control variable, i,as a reference so that we can use i to assign new values to the elements in v. We let auto deduce the type of i. This loop uses a new form of the compound assignment operator (¬ß 1.4.1, p. 12). As we've seen, += adds the right-hand operand to the left and stores the result in the left-hand operand. The *= operator behaves similarly, except that it multiplies the left-and right-hand operands, storing the result in the left-hand one. The second range for prints each element. 
The empty and size members behave as do the corresponding string members (¬ß 3.2.2, p. 87): empty returns a bool indicating whether the vector has any elements, and size returns the number of elements in the vector. The size member returns a value of the size_type defined by the corresponding vector type. 

Note 
To use size_type, we must name the type in which it is defined. A vector type always includes its element type (¬ß 3.3, p. 97): 
vector<int>::size_type // ok vector::size_type // error 
The equality and relational operators have the same behavior as the corresponding string operations (¬ß 3.2.2, p. 88). Two vectors are equal if they have the same number of elements and if the corresponding elements all have the same value. The relational operators apply a dictionary ordering: If the vectors have differing sizes, but the elements that are in common are equal, then the vector with fewer elements is less than the one with more elements. If the elements have differing values, then the relationship between the vectors is determined by the relationship between the first elements that differ. 
We can compare two vectors only if we can compare the elements in those vectors. Some class types, such as string, define the meaning of the equality and relational operators. Others, such as our Sales_item class, do not. The only operations Sales_item supports are those listed in ¬ß 1.5.1 
(p. 20). Those operations did not include the equality or relational operators. As a result, we cannot compare two vector<Sales_item> objects. 

Computing a vector Index 
We can fetch a given element using the subscript operator (¬ß 3.2.3, p. 93). As with strings, subscripts for vector start at 0; the type of a subscript is the corresponding size_type; and' assuming the vector is nonconst'we can write to the element returned by the subscript operator. In addition, as we did in ¬ß 
3.2.3 
(p. 95), we can compute an index and directly fetch the element at that position. 
As an example, let's assume that we have a collection of grades that range from 0 through 100. We'd like to count how many grades fall into various clusters of 10. Between zero and 100 there are 101 possible grades. These grades can be represented by 11 clusters: 10 clusters of 10 grades each plus one cluster for the perfect score of 100. The first cluster will count grades of 0 through 9, the second will count grades from 10 through 19, and so on. The final cluster counts how many scores of 100 were achieved. 
Clustering the grades this way, if our input is 
42 65 95 100 39 67 95 76 88 76 83 92 76 93 
then the output should be 
00011023241 
which indicates that there were no grades below 30, one grade in the 30s, one in the 40s, none in the 50s, two in the 60s, three in the 70s, two in the 80s, four in the 90s, and one grade of 100. 
We'll use a vector with 11 elements to hold the counters for each cluster. We can determine the cluster index for a given grade by dividing that grade by 10. When we divide two integers, we get an integer in which the fractional part is truncated. For example, 42/10 is 4, 65/10 is 6 and 100/10 is 
10. Once we've computed the cluster index, we can use it to subscript our vector and fetch the counter we want to increment: 
// count the number of grades by clusters of ten: 0--9, 10--19, . .. 90--99, 100 vector<unsigned> scores(11, 0); // 11 buckets, all initially 0 
unsigned grade; while (cin >> grade) { // read the grades if (grade <= 100) // handle only valid grades ++scores[grade/10]; // increment the counter for the current cluster 
} 
We start by defining a vector to hold the cluster counts. In this case, we do want each element to have the same value, so we allocate all 11 elements, each of which is initialized to 0. The while condition reads the grades. Inside the loop, we check that the grade we read has a valid value (i.e., that it is less than or equal to 100). Assuming the grade is valid, we increment the appropriate counter for grade. 
The statement that does the increment is a good example of the kind of terse code characteristic of C++ programs. This expression 
++scores[grade/10]; // increment the counter for the current cluster 
is equivalent to 
auto ind = grade/10; // get the bucket index 
scores[ind] = scores[ind] + 1; // increment the count 
We compute the bucket index by dividing grade by 10 and use the result of the division to index scores. Subscripting scores fetches the appropriate counter for this grade. We increment the value of that element to indicate the occurrence of a score in the given range. 
As we've seen, when we use a subscript, we should think about how we know that the indices are in range (¬ß 3.2.3, p. 95). In this program, we verify that the input is a valid grade in the range between 0 and 100. Thus, we know that the indices we can compute are between 0 and 10. These indices are between 0 and scores.size() -1. 
Subscripting Does Not Add Elements 
Programmers new to C++ sometimes think that subscripting a vector adds elements; it does not. The following code intends to add ten elements to ivec: 
vector<int> ivec; // empty vector 
for (decltype(ivec.size()) ix = 0; ix != 10; ++ix) ivec[ix] = ix; // disaster: ivec has no elements 
However, it is in error: ivec is an empty vector; there are no elements to subscript! As we've seen, the right way to write this loop is to use push_back: 
for (decltype(ivec.size()) ix = 0; ix != 10; ++ix) ivec.push_back(ix); // ok: adds a new element with value ix 

Warning 
The subscript operator on vector (and string) fetches an existing element; it does not add an element. 
Caution: Subscript Only Elements that are Known to Exist! 
It is crucially important to understand that we may use the subscript operator (the [] operator) to fetch only elements that actually exist. For example, 
vector<int> ivec; // empty vector cout << ivec[0]; // error: ivec has no elements! 
vector<int> ivec2(10); // vector with ten elements cout << ivec2[10]; // error: ivec2 has elements 0 . . . 9 
It is an error to subscript an element that doesn't exist, but it is an error that the compiler is unlikely to detect. Instead, the value we get at run time is undefined. 
Attempting to subscript elements that do not exist is, unfortunately, an extremely common and pernicious programming error. So-called buffer 
overflow 
errors are the result of subscripting elements that don't exist. Such bugs are the most common cause of security problems in PC and other applications. 

Tip 
A good way to ensure that subscripts are in range is to avoid subscripting altogether by using a range for whenever possible.

3.4. Introducing Iterators 

Although we can use subscripts to access the characters of a string or the elements in a vector, there is a more general mechanism'known as iterators'that we can use for the same purpose. As we'll see in Part 
II, in addition to vector, the library defines several other kinds of containers. All of the library containers have iterators, but only a few of them support the subscript operator. Technically speaking, a string is not a container type, but string supports many of the container operations. As we've seen string, like vector has a subscript operator. Like vectors, strings also have iterators. 
Like pointers (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 52), iterators give us indirect access to an object. In the case of an iterator, that object is an element in a container or a character in a string. We can use an iterator to fetch an element and iterators have operations to move from one element to another. As with pointers, an iterator may be valid or invalid. A valid iterator either denotes an element or denotes a position one past the last element in a container. All other iterator values are invalid. 
3.4.1. Using Iterators 

Unlike pointers, we do not use the address-of operator to obtain an iterator. Instead, types that have iterators have members that return iterators. In particular, these types have members named begin 
and end. The begin member returns an iterator that denotes the first element (or first character), if there is one: 
// the compiler determines the type of b and e; see ¬ß 2.5.2 (p. 68)// b denotes the first element and e denotes one past the last element in v auto b = v.begin(), e = v.end(); // b and e have the same type 
The iterator returned by end is an iterator positioned 'one past the end' of the associated container (or string). This iterator denotes a nonexistent element 'off the end' of the container. It is used as a marker indicating when we have processed all the elements. The iterator returned by end is often referred to as the off-the-end 
iterator 
or abbreviated as 'the end iterator.¬ß If the container is empty, begin returns the same iterator as the one returned by end. 

Note 
If the container is empty, the iterators returned by begin and end are equal'they are both off-the-end iterators. 
In general, we do not know (or care about) the precise type that an iterator has. In this example, we used auto to define b and e (¬ß 2.5.2, p. 68). As a result, these variables have whatever type is returned by the begin and end members, respectively. We'll have more to say about those types on page 108. 

##### Iterator Operations

Iterators support only a few perations, which are listed in Table 3.6. We can compare two alid iterators using `==` or `!=` . Iterators are equal if they denote the same element or if they are both off-the-end iterators for the same container. Otherwise, they are unequal. 

Table 3.6. Standard Container Iterator Operations 

As with pointers, we can dereference an iterator to obtain the element denoted by an iterator. Also, like pointers, we may dereference only a valid iterator that denotes an element (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 53). Dereferencing an invalid iterator or an off-the-end iterator has undefined behavior. 
As an example, we'll rewrite the program from ¬ß 3.2.3 
(p. 94) that capitalized the first character of a string using an iterator instead of a subscript: 
string s("some string"); 
if (s.begin() != s.end()) { // make sure s is not empty auto it = s.begin(); // it denotes the first character in s *it = toupper(*it); // make that character uppercase 
} As in our original program, we first check that s isn't empty. In this case, we do so by comparing the iterators returned by begin and end. Those iterators are equal if the string is empty. If they are unequl, there is at least one character in s. 
Inside the if body, we obtain an iterator to the first character by assigning the iterator returned by begin to it. We dereference that iterator to pass that character to toupper. We also dereference it on the left-hand side of the assignment in order to assign the character returned from toupper to the first character in s. As in our original program, the output of this loop will be: 
Some string 
Moving Iterators from One Element to Another 
Iterators use the increment (++) operator (¬ß 1.4.1, p. 12) to move from one element to the next. Incrementing an iterator is a logically similar operation to incrementing an integer. In the case of integers, the effect is to 'add 1' to the integer's value. In the case of iterators, the effect is to 'advance the iterator by one position.¬ß 

Note 
Because the iterator returned from end does not denote an element, it may not be incremented or dereferenced. 
Using the increment operator, we can rewrite our program that changed the case of the first word in a string to use iterators instead: 
// process characters in s until we run out of characters or we hit a whitespace 
for (auto it = s.begin(); it != s.end() && !isspace(*it); ++it) *it = toupper(*it); // capitalize the current character 
This loop, like the one in ¬ß 3.2.3 
(p. 94), iterates through the characters in s, stopping when we encounter a whitespace character. However, this loop accesses these characters using an iterator, not a subscript. 
The loop starts by initializing it from s.begin, meaning that it denotes the first character (if any) in s. The condition checks whether it has reached the end of s. If not, the condition next dereferences it to pass the current character to isspace to see whether we're done. At the end of each iteration, we execute ++it to advance the iterator to access the next character in s. 
The body of this loop, is the same as the last statement in the previous if. We dereference it to pass the current character to toupper and assign the resulting uppercase letter back into the 
character denoted by it. 
Key Concept: Generic Programming 
Programmers coming to C++ from C or Java might be surprised that we used != rather than < in our for loops such as the one above and in the one on page 94. C++ programmers use != as a matter of habit. They do so for the same reason that they use iterators rather than subscripts: This coding style applies equally well to various kinds of containers provided by the library. 
As we've seen, only a few library types, vector and string being among them, have the subscript operator. Similarly, all of the library containers have iterators that define the == and != operators. Most of those iterators do not have the < operator. By routinely using iterators and !=, we don't have to worry about the precise type of container we're processing. 

Iterator Types 
Just as we do not know the precise type of a vector's or string's size_type member (¬ß 3.2.2, p. 88), so too, we generally do not know'and do not need to know'the precise type of an iterator. Instead, as with size_type, the library types that have iterators define types named iterator and const_iterator that represent actual iterator types: 
vector<int>::iterator it; // it can read and write vector<int> elements string::iterator it2; // it2 can read and write characters in a string vector<int>::const_iterator it3; // it3 can read but not write elements string::const_iterator it4; // it4 can read but not write characters 
A const_iterator behaves like a const pointer (¬ß 2.4.2, p. 62). Like a const pointer, a const_iterator may read but not write the element it denotes; an object of type iterator can both read and write. If a vector or string is const, we may use only its const_iterator type. With a nonconst vector or string, we can use either iterator or const_iterator. 
Terminology: Iterators and Iterator Types The term iterator is used to refer to three different entities. We might mean the concept of an iterator, or we might refer to the iterator type defined by a container, or we might refer to an object as an iterator. 
What's important to understand is that there is a collection of types that are related conceptually. A type is an iterator if it supports a common set of actions. Those actions let us access an element in a container and let us move from one element to another. 
Each container class defines a type named iterator; that iterator type supports the actions of an (conceptual) iterator. 

The begin and end Operations 
The type returned by begin and end depends on whether the object on which they operator is const. If the object is const, then begin and end return a const_iterator; if the object is not const, they return iterator: 
vector<int> v; const vector<int> cv; auto it1 = v.begin(); // it1 has type vector<int>::iterator auto it2 = cv.begin(); // it2 has type vector<int>::const_iterator 
Often this default behavior is not what we want. For reasons we'll explain in ¬ß 6.2.3 
(p. 213), it is usually best to use a const type (such as const_iterator) when we need to read but do not need to write to an object. To let us ask specifically for the const_iterator type, the new standard introduced two new functions named cbegin and cend: 

auto it3 = v.cbegin(); // it3 has type vector<int>::const_iterator 
As do the begin and end members, these members return iterators to the first and one past the last element in the container. However, regardless of whether the vector (or string) is const, they return a const_iterator. 

Combining Dereference and Member Access 
When we dereference an iterator, we get the object that the iterator denotes. If that object has a class type, we may want to access a member of that object. For example, we might have a vector of strings and we might need to know whether a given element is empty. Assuming it is an iterator into this vector, we can check whether the string that it denotes is empty as follows: 
(*it).empty() 
For reasons we'll cover in ¬ß 4.1.2 
(p. 136), the parentheses in (*it).empty() are necessary. The parentheses say to apply the dereference operator to it and to apply the dot operator (¬ß 1.5.2, p. 23) to the result of dereferencing it. Without parentheses, the dot operator would apply to it, not to the The second expression is interpreted as a request to fetch the empty member from the object named it. However, it is an iterator and has no member named empty. Hence, the second expression is in error. 
resulting object:  
(*it).empty() resulting object *it.empty() it //  // dereferences it and calls the member empty on the // error: attempts to fetch the member named empty from but it is an iterator and has no member named empty  

To simplify expressions such as this one, the language defines the arrow operator (the -> 
operator). The arrow operator combines dereference and member access into a single operation. That is, it->mem is a synonym for (* it).mem. 
For example, assume we have a vector<string> named text that holds the data from a text file. Each element in the vector is either a sentence or an empty string representing a paragraph break. If we want to print the contents of the first paragraph from text, we'd write a loop that iterates through text until we encounter an element that is empty: 
// print each line in text up to the first blank line 
for (auto it = text.cbegin(); 
it != text.cend() && !it->empty(); ++it) 
cout << *it << endl; We start by initializing it to denote the first element in text. The loop continues until either we process every element in text or we find an element that is empty. So long as there are elements and we haven't seen an empty element, we print the current element. It is worth noting that because the loop reads but does not write to the elements in text, we use cbegin and cend to control the iteration. 

Some vector Operations Invalidate Iterators 
In ¬ß 3.3.2 
(p. 101) we noted that there are implications of the fact that vectors can grow dynamically. We also noted that one such implication is that we cannot add elements to a vector inside a range for loop. Another implication is that any operation, such as push_back, that changes the size of a vector potentially invalidates all iterators into that vector. We'll explore 
how iterators become invalid in more detail in ¬ß 9.3.6 
(p. 353). 

Warning 
For now, it is important to realize that loops that use iterators should not add elements to the container to which the iterators refer.

(p. 
105) using iterators. Exercise 3.22: Revise the loop that printed the first paragraph in text to instead change the elements in

ten int elements. Using an iterator, assign each element a value that is twice its current value. Test your program by printing the vector. 
3.4.2. Iterator Arithmetic 

Incrementing an iterator moves the iterator one element at a time. All the library containers have iterators that support increment. Similarly, we can use == and != to compare two valid iterators (¬ß 3.4, p. 106) into any of the library container types. 
Iterators for string and vector support additional operations that can move an iterator multiple elements at a time. They also support all the relational operators. These operations, which are often referred to as iterator 
arithmetic, are described in Table 
3.7. 


Arithmetic Operations on Iterators 
We can add (or subtract) an integral value and an iterator. Doing so returns an iterator positioned forward (or backward) that many elements. When we add or subtract an integral value and an iterator, the result must denote an element in the same vector (or string) or denote one past the end of the associated vector (or string). As an example, we can compute an iterator to the element nearest the middle of a vector: 
// compute an iterator to the element closest to the midpoint of vi 
auto mid = vi.begin() + vi.size() / 2; If vi has 20 elements, then vi.size()/2 is 10. In this case, we'd set mid equal to vi.begin() + 10. Remembering that subscripts start at 0, this element is the same as vi[10], the element ten past the first. 
In addition to comparing two iterators for equality, we can compare vector and string iterators using the relational operators (<, <=, >, >=). The iterators must be valid and must denote elements in (or one past the end of) the same vector or string. For example, assuming it is an iterator into the same vector as mid, we can check whether it denotes an element before or after mid as follows: 
if (it < mid) // process elements in the first half of vi 
We can also subtract two iterators so long as they refer to elements in, or one off the end of, the same vector or string. The result is the distance between the iterators. By distance we mean the amount by which we'd have to change one iterator to get the other. The result type is a signed integral type named difference_type. Both vector and string define difference_type. This type is signed, because subtraction might have a negative result. 

Using Iterator Arithmetic 
A classic algorithm that uses iterator arithmetic is binary search. A binary search looks for a particular value in a sorted sequence. It operates by looking at the element closest to the middle of the sequence. If that element is the one we want, we're done. Otherwise, if that element is smaller than the one we want, we continue our search by looking only at elements after the rejected one. If the middle element is larger than the one we want, we continue by looking only in the first half. We compute a new middle element in the reduced range and continue looking until we either find the element or run out of elements. 
We can do a binary search using iterators as follows: 
// text must be sorted 
// beg and end will denote the range we're searching 
auto beg = text.begin(), end = text.end(); 
auto mid = text.begin() + (end -beg)/2; // original midpoint 
// while there are still elements to look at and we haven't yet found sought 
while (mid != end && *mid != sought) { 
if (sought < *mid) // is the element we want in the first half? end = mid; // if so, adjust the range to ignore the second 
half else // the element we want is in the second half beg =mid +1; // start looking with the element just after 
mid 
mid = beg + (end -beg)/2; // new midpoint 
} We start by defining three iterators: beg will be the first element in the range, end one past the last element, and mid the element closest to the middle. We initialize these iterators to denote the entire range in a vector<string> named text. 
Our loop first checks that the range is not empty. If mid is equal to the current value of end, then we've run out of elements to search. In this case, the condition fails and we exit the while. Otherwise, mid refers to an element and we check whether mid denotes the one we want. If so, we're done and we exit the loop. 
If we still have elements to process, the code inside the while adjusts the range by moving end or beg. If the element denoted by mid is greater than sought, we know that if sought is in text, it will appear before the element denoted by mid. Therefore, we can ignore elements after mid, which we do by assigning mid to end. If *mid is smaller than sought, the element must be in the range of elements after the one denoted by mid. In this case, we adjust the range by making beg denote the element just after mid. We already know that mid is not the one we want, so we can eliminate it from the range. 
At the end of the while, mid will be equal to end or it will denote the element for which we are looking. If mid equals end, then the element was not in text.

105) using iterators. Exercise 3.25: Rewrite the grade clustering program from

3.5. Arrays 
An array is a data structure that is similar to the library vector type (¬ß 3.3, p. 96) but offers a different trade-off between performance and flexibility. Like a vector, an array is a container of unnamed objects of a single type that we access by position. Unlike a vector, arrays have fixed size; we cannot add elements to an array. Because arrays have fixed size, they sometimes offer better run-time performance for specialized applications. However, that run-time advantage comes at the cost of lost flexibility. 

Tip 
If you don't know exactly how many elements you need, use a vector. 
3.5.1. Defining and Initializing Built-in Arrays 
Arrays are a compound type (¬ß 2.3, p. 50). An array declarator has the form a[d], where a is the name being defined and d is the dimension of the array. The dimension specifies the number of elements and must be greater than zero. The number of elements in an array is part of the array's type. As a result, the dimension must be known at compile time, which means that the dimension must be a constant expression (¬ß 2.4.4, p. 65): 
unsigned cnt = 42; // not a constant expression 
constexpr unsigned sz = 42; // constant expression 
// constexpr see ¬ß 2.4.4 (p. 66) int arr[10]; // array of ten ints int *parr[sz]; // array of 42 pointers to int string bad[cnt]; // error: cnt is not a constant expression string strs[get_size()]; // ok if get_size is constexpr, error otherwise 
By default, the elements in an array are default initialized (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43). 

Warning 
As with variables of built-in type, a default-initialized array of built-in type that is defined inside a function will have undefined values. 
When we define an array, we must specify a type for the array. We cannot use auto to deduce the type from a list of initializers. As with vector, arrays hold objects. Thus, there are no arrays of references. 

Explicitly Initializing Array Elements 
We can list initialize (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 98) the elements in an array. When we do so, we can omit the dimension. If we omit the dimension, the compiler infers it from the number of initializers. If we specify a dimension, the number of initializers must not exceed the specified size. If the dimension is greater than the number of initializers, the initializers are used for the first elements and any remaining elements are value initialized (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 98): 
const unsigned sz = 3; int ia1[sz] = {0,1,2}; // array of three ints with values 0, 1, 2 int a2[] = {0, 1, 2}; // an array of dimension 3 int a3[5] = {0, 1, 2}; // equivalent to a3[] = {0, 1, 2, 0, 0} string a4[3] = {"hi", "bye"}; // same as a4[] = {"hi", "bye", ""} int a5[2] = {0,1,2}; // error: too many initializers 
Character Arrays Are Special 
Character arrays have an additional form of initialization: We can initialize such arrays from a string literal (¬ß 2.1.3, p. 39). When we use this form of initialization, it is important to remember that string literals end with a null character. That null character is copied into the array along with the characters in the literal: 
char a1[] = {'C', '+', '+'}; // list initialization, no null char a2[] = {'C', '+', '+', '\0'}; // list initialization, explicit null char a3[] = "C++"; // null terminator added automatically const char a4[6] = "Daniel"; // error: no space for the null! 
The dimension of a1 is 3; the dimensions of a2 and a3 are both 
4. The definition of a4 is in error. Although the literal contains only six explicit characters, the array size must be at least seven'six to hold the literal and one for the null. 

No Copy or Assignment 
We cannot initialize an array as a copy of another array, nor is it legal to assign one array to another: 
int a[] = {0, 1, 2}; // array of three ints 
int a2[] = a; // error: cannot initialize one array with another 
a2 =a; // error: cannot assign one array to another

extension.

idea 
to

using 
nonstandard features. Programs that use such features, will not work with a different compiler. 

Understanding Complicated Array Declarations 
Like vectors, arrays can hold objects of most any type. For example, we can have an array of pointers. Because an array is an object, we can define both pointers and references to arrays. Defining arrays that hold pointers is fairly straightforward, defining a pointer or reference to an array is a bit more complicated: 
int *ptrs[10]; // ptrs is an array of ten pointers to int 
int &refs[10] = /* ? */; // error: no arrays of references 
int (*Parray)[10] = &arr; // Parray points to an array of ten ints 
int (&arrRef)[10] = arr; // arrRef refers to an array of ten ints 
By default, type modifiers bind right to left. Reading the definition of ptrs from right to left (¬ß 2.3.3, p. 58) is easy: We see that we're defining an array of size 10, named ptrs, that holds pointers to int. 
Reading the definition of Parray from right to left isn't as helpful. Because the array dimension follows the name being declared, it can be easier to read array declarations from the inside out rather than from right to left. Reading from the inside out makes it much easier to understand the type of Parray. We start by observing that the parentheses around *Parray mean that Parray is a pointer. Looking right, we see that Parray points to an array of size 10. Looking left, we see that the elements in that array are ints. Thus, Parray is a pointer to an array of ten ints. Similarly, (&arrRef) says that arrRef is a reference. The type to which it refers is an array of size 10. That array holds elements of type int. 
Of course, there are no limits on how many type modifiers can be used: 
int *(&arry)[10] = ptrs; // arry is a reference to an array of ten pointers 
Reading this declaration from the inside out, we see that arry is a reference. Looking right, we see that the object to which arry refers is an array of size 10. Looking left, we see that the element type is pointer to int. Thus, arry is a reference to an array of ten pointers. 

Tip 
It can be easier to understand array declarations by starting with the array's name and reading them from the inside out.

3.5.2. Accessing the Elements of an Array 
As with the library vector and string types, we can use a range for or the subscript operator to access elements of an array. As usual, the indices start at 0. For an array of ten elements, the indices are 0 through 9, not 1 through 10. 
When we use a variable to subscript an array, we normally should define that variable to have type size_t. size_t is a machine-specific unsigned type that is guaranteed to be large enough to hold the size of any object in memory. The size_t type is defined in the cstddef header, which is the C++ version of the stddef.h header from the C library. 
With the exception that arrays are fixed size, we use arrays in ways that are similar to how we use vectors. For example, we can reimplement our grading program from ¬ß 3.3.3 
(p. 104) to use an array to hold the cluster counters: 
// count the number of grades by clusters of ten: 0--9, 10--19, ... 90--99, 100 unsigned scores[11] = {}; // 11 buckets, all value initialized to 0 
unsigned grade; 
while (cin >> grade) { 
if (grade <= 100) 
++scores[grade/10]; // increment the counter for the current 
cluster 
} 
The only obvious difference between this program and the one on page 104 
is the declaration of scores. In this program scores is an array of 11 unsigned elements. The not so obvious difference is that the subscript operator in this program is the one that is defined as part of the language. This operator can be used on operands of array type. The subscript operator used in the program on page 104 
was defined by the library vector template and applies to operands of type vector. 
As in the case of string or vector, it is best to use a range for when we want to traverse the entire array. For example, we can print the resulting scores as follows: 
for (auto i : scores) // for each counter in scores cout << i<< ""; // print the value of that counter 
cout << endl; Because the dimension is part of each array type, the system knows how many elements are in scores. Using a range for means that we don't have to manage the traversal ourselves. 

Checking Subscript Values 
As with string and vector, it is up to the programmer to ensure that the subscript value is in range'that is, that the index value is equal to or greater than zero and less than the size of the array. Nothing stops a program from stepping across an array boundary except careful attention to detail and thorough testing of the code. It is possible for programs to compile and execute yet still be fatally wrong. 

Warning 
The most common source of security problems are buffer overflow bugs. Such bugs occur when a program fails to check a subscript and mistakenly uses memory outside the range of an array or similar data structure.

3.5.3. Pointers and Arrays 
In C++ pointers and arrays are closely intertwined. In particular, as we'll see, when we use an array, the compiler ordinarily converts the array to a pointer. 
Normally, we obtain a pointer to an object by using the address-of operator (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 52). Generally speaking, the address-of operator may be applied to any object. The elements in an array are objects. When we subscript an array, the result is the object at that location in the array. As with any other object, we can obtain a pointer to an array element by taking the address of that element: 
string nums[] = {"one", "two", "three"}; // array of strings 
string *p = &nums[0]; // p points to the first element in nums 
However, arrays have a special property'in most places when we use an array, the compiler automatically substitutes a pointer to the first element: 
string *p2 = nums; // equivalent to p2 = &nums[0] 

Note 
In most expressions, when we use an object of array type, we are really using a pointer to the first element 
in that array. 
There are various implications of the fact that operations on arrays are often really operations on pointers. One such implication is that when we use an array as an initializer for a variable defined using auto (¬ß 2.5.2, p. 68), the deduced type is a pointer, not an array: 
int ia[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; // ia is an array of ten ints auto ia2(ia); // ia2 is an int* that points to the first element in ia ia2 =42; // error: ia2 is a pointer, and we can't assign an int to a pointer 
Although ia is an array of ten ints, when we use ia as an initializer, the compiler treats that initialization as if we had written 
auto ia2(&ia[0]); // now it's clear that ia2 has type int* 
It is worth noting that this conversion does not happen when we use decltype (¬ß 2.5.3, p. 70). The type returned by decltype(ia) is array of ten ints: 
// ia3 is an array of ten ints 
decltype(ia) ia3 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; 
ia3 =p; // error: can't assign an int* to an array 
ia3[4] = i; // ok: assigns the value of i to an element in ia3 

Pointers Are Iterators 
Pointers that address elements in an array have additional operations beyond those we described in ¬ß 2.3.2 
(p. 52). In particular, pointers to array elements support the same operations as iterators on vectors or strings (¬ß 3.4, p. 106). For example, we can use the increment operator to move from one element in an array to the next: 
int arr[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; 
int *p = arr; // p points to the first element in arr 
++p; // p points to arr[1] 
Just as we can use iterators to traverse the elements in a vector, we can use pointers to traverse the elements in an array. Of course, to do so, we need to obtain pointers to the first and one past the last element. As we've just seen, we can obtain a pointer to the first element by using the array itself or by taking the address-of the first element. We can obtain an off-the-end pointer by using another special property of arrays. We can take the address of the nonexistent element one past the last element of an array: 
int *e = &arr[10]; // pointer just past the last element in arr 
Here we used the subscript operator to index a nonexisting element; arr has ten elements, so the last element in arr is at index position 9. The only thing we can do with this element is take its address, which we do to initialize e. Like an off-the-end iterator (¬ß 3.4.1, p. 106), an off-the-end pointer does not point to an element. As a result, we may not dereference or increment an off-the-end pointer. 
Using these pointers we can write a loop to print the elements in arr as follows: 
for (int *b = arr; b != e; ++b) cout << *b << endl; // print the elements in arr 
The Library begin and end Functions 

Although we can compute an off-the-end pointer, doing so is error-prone. To make it easier and safer to use pointers, the new library includes two functions, named begin and end. These functions act like the similarly named container members (¬ß 3.4.1, p. 106). However, arrays are not class types, so these functions are not member functions. Instead, they take an argument that is an array: 
int ia[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; // ia is an array of ten ints 
int *beg = begin(ia); // pointer to the first element in ia 
int *last = end(ia); // pointer one past the last element in ia 
begin returns a pointer to the first, and end returns a pointer one past the last element in the given array: These functions are defined in the iterator header. 
Using begin and end, it is easy to write a loop to process the elements in an array. For example, assuming arr is an array that holds int values, we might find the first negative value in arr as follows: 
// pbeg points to the first and pend points just past the last element in arr 
int *pbeg = begin(arr), *pend = end(arr); 
// find the first negative element, stopping if we've seen all the elements 
while (pbeg != pend && *pbeg >= 0) 
++pbeg; We start by defining two int pointers named pbeg and pend. We position pbeg to denote the first element and pend to point one past the last element in arr. The while condition uses pend to know whether it is safe to dereference pbeg. If pbeg does point at an element, we dereference and check whether the underlying element is negative. If so, the condition fails and we exit the loop. If not, we increment the pointer to look at the next element. 

Note 
A pointer 'one past' the end of a built-in array behaves the same way as the iterator returned by the end operation of a vector. In particular, we may not dereference or increment an off-the-end pointer. 


Pointer Arithmetic 
Pointers that address array elements can use all the iterator operations listed in Table 
3.6 
(p. 107) and Table 
3.7 
(p. 111). These operations'dereference, increment, comparisons, addition of an integral value, subtraction of two pointers'have the same meaning when applied to pointers that point at elements in a built-in array as they do when applied to iterators. 
When we add (or subtract) an integral value to (or from) a pointer, the result is a new pointer. That new pointer points to the element the given number ahead of (or behind) the original pointer: 
constexpr size_t sz = 5; 
int arr[sz] = {1,2,3,4,5}; 
int *ip = arr; // equivalent to int *ip = &arr[0] 
int *ip2 =ip +4;// ip2 points to arr[4], the last element in arr 
The result of adding 4 to ip is a pointer that points to the element four elements further on in the array from the one to which ip currently points. 
The result of adding an integral value to a pointer must be a pointer to an element in the same array, or a pointer just past the end of the array: 
// ok: arr is converted to a pointer to its first element; p points one past the end of arr int *p =arr + sz;// use caution --do not dereference! int *p2 = arr + 10; // error: arr has only 5 elements; p2 has undefined value 
When we add sz to arr, the compiler converts arr to a pointer to the first element in arr. When we add sz to that pointer, we get a pointer that points sz positions (i.e., 5 positions) past the first one. That is, it points one past the last element in arr. Computing a pointer more than one past the last element is an error, although the compiler is unlikely to detect such errors. 
As with iterators, subtracting two pointers gives us the distance between those pointers. The pointers must point to elements in the same array: 
auto n = end(arr) -begin(arr); // n is 5, the number of elements in arr 
The result of subtracting two pointers is a library type named ptrdiff_t. Like size_t, the ptrdiff_t type is a machine-specific type and is defined in the cstddef header. Because subtraction might yield a negative distance, ptrdiff_t is a signed integral type. 
We can use the relational operators to compare pointers that point to elements of an array, or one past the last element in that array. For example, we can traverse the elements in arr as follows: 
int *b = arr, *e = arr + sz; while (b < e) { // use *b 
++b; } 
We cannot use the relational operators on pointers to two unrelated objects: 
int i= 0, sz =42; 
int *p = &i, *e = &sz; 
// undefined: p and e are unrelated; comparison is meaningless! 
while (p < e) 
Although the utility may be obscure at this point, it is worth noting that pointer arithmetic is also valid for null pointers (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 53) and for pointers that point to an object that is not an array. In the latter case, the pointers must point to the same object, or one past that object. If p is a null pointer, we can add or subtract an integral constant expression (¬ß 2.4.4, p. 65) whose value is 0 to p. We can also subtract two null pointers from one another, in which case the result is 0. 

Interaction between Dereference and Pointer Arithmetic 
The result of adding an integral value to a pointer is itself a pointer. Assuming the resulting pointer points to an element, we can dereference the resulting pointer: 
int ia[] = {0,2,4,6,8}; // array with 5 elements of type int 
int last = *(ia + 4); // ok: initializes last to 8, the value of ia[4] 
The expression *(ia + 4) calculates the address four elements past ia and dereferences the resulting pointer. This expression is equivalent to writing ia[4]. 
Recall that in ¬ß 3.4.1 
(p. 109) we noted that parentheses are required in expressions that contain dereference and dot operators. Similarly, the parentheses around this pointer addition are essential. Writing 
last =*ia +4; // ok: last = 4, equivalent to ia[0] + 4 
means dereference ia and add 4 to the dereferenced value. We'll cover the reasons for this behavior in ¬ß 4.1.2 
(p. 136). 
Subscripts and Pointers 

As we've seen, in most places when we use the name of an array, we are really using a pointer to the first element in that array. One place where the compiler does this transformation is when we subscript an array. Given 
int ia[] = {0,2,4,6,8}; // array with 5 elements of type int if we write ia[0], that is an expression that uses the name of an 
array. When we subscript an array, we are really subscripting a pointer to an element in that array: 
int i = ia[2]; // ia is converted to a pointer to the first element in ia 
// ia[2] fetches the element to which (ia + 2) points 
int *p =ia; // p points to the first element in ia 
i=*(p +2); // equivalent to i = ia[2] 
We can use the subscript operator on any pointer, as long as that pointer points to an element (or one past the last element) in an array: 
int *p = &ia[2]; // p points to the element indexed by 2 int j = p[1]; // p[1] is equivalent to *(p + 1), // p[1] is the same element as ia[3] int k = p[-2]; // p[-2] is the same element as ia[0] 
This last example points out an important difference between arrays and library types such as vector and string that have subscript operators. The library types force the index used with a subscript to be an unsigned value. The built-in subscript operator does not. The index used with the built-in subscript operator can be a negative value. Of course, the resulting address must point to an element in (or one past the end of) the array to which the original pointer points. 

Warning 
Unlike subscripts for vector and string, the index of the built-in subscript operator is not an unsigned type. 
Exercises Section 3.5.3 Exercise 3.34: Given that p1 and p2 point to elements in the same array, what does the following code do? Are there values of p1 or p2 that make this code illegal? 
p1 += p2 -p1; 
Exercise 3.35: Using pointers, write a program to set 
the elements in an array to zero. Exercise 3.36: Write a program to compare two arrays for equality. Write a similar program to compare two vectors. 
3.5.4. C-Style Character Strings 

Warning 
Although C++ supports C-style strings, they should not be used by C++ programs. C-style strings are a surprisingly rich source of bugs and are the root cause of many security problems. They're also harder to use! 
Character string literals are an instance of a more general construct 
that 
C++ 
inherits 
from 
C: 
C-style 
character 
strings. 
C-style 
strings 
are 
not 
a 
type. 
Instead, 
they 
are a convention for how to represent and use character strings. Strings that follow this convention are stored in character arrays and are null 
terminated. By null-terminated we mean that the last character in the string is followed by a null character ('\0'). Ordinarily we use pointers to manipulate these strings. 

C Library String Functions 
The Standard C library provides a set of functions, listed in Table 
3.8, that operate on C-style strings. These functions are defined in the cstring header, which is the C++ version of the C header string.h. 


Warning 
The functions in Table 
3.8 
do not verify their string parameters. 
The pointer(s) passed to these routines must point to null-terminated array(s): 
char ca[] = {'C', '+', '+'}; // not null terminated 
cout << strlen(ca) << endl; // disaster: ca isn't null terminated 
In this case, ca is an array of char but is not null terminated. The result is undefined. The most likely effect of this call is that strlen will keep looking through the memory that follows ca until it encounters a null character. 

Comparing Strings 
Comparing two C-style strings is done quite differently from how we compare library strings. When we compare two library strings, we use the normal relational or equality operators: 
string s1 = "A string example"; 
string s2 = "A different string"; 
if (s1 <s2) // false: s2 is less than s1 
Using these operators on similarly defined C-style strings compares the pointer values, not the strings themselves: 
const char ca1[] = "A string example"; const char ca2[] = "A different string"; 
if (ca1 < ca2) // undefined: compares two unrelated addresses 
Remember that when we use an array, we are really using a pointer to the first element in the array (¬ß 3.5.3, p. 117). Hence, this condition actually compares two const char* values. Those pointers do not address the same object, so the comparison is undefined. 
To compare the strings, rather than the pointer values, we can call strcmp. That function returns 0 if the strings are equal, or a positive or negative value, depending on whether the first string is larger or smaller than the second: 
if (strcmp(ca1, ca2) < 0) // same effect as string comparison s1 < s2 

Caller Is Responsible for Size of a Destination String 
Concatenating or copying C-style strings is also very different from the same operations on library strings. For example, if we wanted to concatenate the two strings s1 and s2 defined above, we can do so directly: 
// initialize largeStr as a concatenation of s1, a space, and s2 
string largeStr = s1 + " " + s2; 
Doing the same with our two arrays, ca1 and ca2, would be an error. The expression ca1 + ca2 tries to add two pointers, which is illegal and meaningless. 
Instead we can use strcat and strcpy. However, to use these functions, we must pass an array to hold the resulting string. The array we pass must be large enough to hold the generated string, including the null character at the end. The code we show here, although a common usage pattern, is fraught with potential for serious error: 
// disastrous if we miscalculated the size of largeStr strcpy(largeStr, ca1); // copies ca1 into largeStr 
strcat(largeStr, " "); // adds a space at the end of largeStr 
strcat(largeStr, ca2); // concatenates ca2 onto largeStr 
The problem is that we can easily miscalculate the size needed for largeStr. Moreover, any time we change the values we want to store in largeStr, we have to remember to double-check that we calculated its size correctly. Unfortunately, programs similar to this code are widely distributed. Programs with such code are error-prone and often lead to serious security leaks. 

Tip 
For most applications, in addition to being safer, it is also more efficient to use library strings rather than C-style strings. 
Exercises Section 3.5.4 
Exercise 3.37: What does the following program do? 
const char ca[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}; const char *cp = ca; while (*cp) { 
cout << *cp << endl; 
++cp; } 
Exercise 3.38: In this section, we noted that it was not only illegal but meaningless to try to add two pointers. Why would adding two pointers be meaningless? 
Exercise 3.39: Write a program to compare two strings. Now write a program to compare the values of two C-style character strings. 
Exercise 3.40: Write a program to define two character arrays initialized from string literals. Now define a third character array to hold the concatenation of the two arrays. Use strcpy and strcat to copy the two arrays into the third. 
3.5.5. Interfacing to Older Code 
Many C++ programs predate the standard library and do not use the string and vector types. Moreover, many C++ programs interface to programs written in C or other languages that cannot use the C++ library. Hence, programs written in modern C++ may have to interface to code that uses arrays and/or C-style character strings. The C++ library offers facilities to make the interface easier to manage. 

Mixing Library strings and C-Style Strings 

In ¬ß 3.2.1 
(p. 84) we saw that we can initialize a string from a string literal: 
string s("Hello World"); // s holds Hello World 
More generally, we can use a null-terminated character array anywhere that we can use a string literal: 
. 
We can use a null-terminated character array to initialize or assign a string. 

. 
We can use a null-terminated character array as one operand (but not both operands) to the string addition operator or as the right-hand operand in the string compound assignment (+=) operator. 


The reverse functionality is not provided: There is no direct way to use a library string when a C-style string is required. For example, there is no way to initialize a character pointer from a string. There is, however, a string member function named c_str that we can often use to accomplish what we want: 
char *str = s; // error: can't initialize a char* from a string 
const char *str = s.c_str(); // ok The name c_str indicates that the function returns a C-style character string. That is, it returns a pointer to the beginning of a null-terminated character array that holds the same data as the characters in the string. The type of the pointer is const char*, which prevents us from changing the contents of the array. 
The array returned by c_str is not guaranteed to be valid indefinitely. Any subsequent use of s that might change the value of s can invalidate this array. 

Warning 
If a program needs continuing access to the contents of the array returned by str(), the program must copy the array returned by c_str. 

Using an Array to Initialize a vector 
In ¬ß 3.5.1 
(p. 114) we noted that we cannot initialize a built-in array from another array. Nor can we initialize an array from a vector. However, we can use an array to initialize a vector. To do so, we specify the address of the first element and one past the last element that we wish to copy: 
int int_arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // ivec has six elements; each is a copy of the corresponding element in int_arr 
vector<int> ivec(begin(int_arr), end(int_arr)); 
The two pointers used to construct ivec mark the range of values to use to initialize the elements in ivec. The second pointer points one past the last element to be copied. In this case, we used the library begin and end functions (¬ß 3.5.3, p. 
118) to pass pointers to the first and one past the last elements in int_arr. As a result, ivec will have six elements each of which will have the same value as the corresponding element in int_arr. 
The specified range can be a subset of the array: 
// copies three elements: int_arr[1], int_arr[2], int_arr[3] 
vector<int> subVec(int_arr + 1, int_arr + 4); This initialization creates subVec with three elements. The values of these elements are copies of the values in int_arr[1] through int_arr[3]. 
Advice: Use Library Types Instead of Arrays 
Pointers and arrays are surprisingly error-prone. Part of the problem is conceptual: Pointers are used for low-level manipulations and it is easy to make bookkeeping mistakes. Other problems arise because of the syntax, particularly the declaration syntax used with pointers. 
Modern C++ programs should use vectors and iterators instead of built-in arrays and pointers, and use strings rather than C-style array-based character strings. 
3.6. Multidimensional Arrays 

Strictly speaking, there are no multidimensional arrays in C++. What are commonly referred to as multidimensional arrays are actually arrays of arrays. It can be helpful to keep this fact in mind when you use what appears to be a multidimensional array. 
Exercises Section 3.5.5 
Exercise 3.41: Write a program to initialize a vector from an array of ints. Exercise 3.42: Write a program to copy a vector of 
ints into an array of ints. 
We define an array whose elements are arrays by providing two dimensions: the dimension of the array itself and the dimension of its elements: 
int ia[3][4]; // array of size 3; each element is an array of ints of size 4// array of size 10; each element is a 20-element array whose elements are arrays of 30 ints int arr[10][20][30] = {0}; // initialize all elements to 0 
As we saw in ¬ß 3.5.1 
(p. 115), we can more easily understand these definitions by reading them from the inside out. We start with the name we're defining (ia) and see that ia is an array of size 3. Continuing to look to the right, we see that the elements of ia also have a dimension. Thus, the elements in ia are themselves arrays of size 4. Looking left, we see that the type of those elements is int. So, ia is an array of size 3, each of whose elements is an array of four ints. 
We read the definition for arr in the same way. First we see that arr is an array of size 10. The elements of that array are themselves arrays of size 20. Each of those arrays has 30 elements that are of type int. There is no limit on how many subscripts are used. That is, we can have an array whose elements are arrays of elements that are arrays, and so on. 
In a two-dimensional array, the first dimension is usually referred to as the row and the second as the column. 
Initializing the Elements of a Multidimensional Array 
As with any array, we can initialize the elements of a multidimensional array by providing a bracketed list of initializers. Multidimensional arrays may be initialized by specifying bracketed values for each row: 
int ia[3][4] = { // three elements; each element is an array of size 4 
{0, 1, 2, 3}, // initializers for the row indexed by 0 {4, 5, 6, 7}, // initializers for the row indexed by 1 {8, 9, 10, 11} // initializers for the row indexed by 2 
}; 
The nested braces are optional. The following initialization is equivalent, although considerably less clear: 
// equivalent initialization without the optional nested braces for each row int ia[3][4] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}; 
As is the case for single-dimension arrays, elements may be left out of the initializer list. We can initialize only the first element of each row as follows: 
// explicitly initialize only element 0 in each row int ia[3][4] = {{ 0 }, { 4}, { 8 }}; 
The remaining elements are value initialized in the same way as ordinary, single-dimension arrays (¬ß 3.5.1, p. 114). If the nested braces were omitted, the results would be very different. This code 
// explicitly initialize row 0; the remaining elements are value initialized 
int ix[3][4] = {0, 3, 6, 9}; 
initializes the elements of the first row. The remaining elements are initialized to 0. 
Subscripting a Multidimensional Array 
As with any array, we can use a subscript to access the elements of a multidimensional array. To do so, we use a separate subscript for each dimension. 
If an expression provides as many subscripts as there are dimensions, we get an element with the specified type. If we supply fewer subscripts than there are dimensions, then the result is the inner-array element at the specified index: 
// assigns the first element of arr to the last element in the last row of ia 
ia[2][3] = arr[0][0][0]; int (&row)[4] = ia[1]; // binds row to the second four-element array in ia 
In the first example we supply indices for all the dimensions for both arrays. On the left-hand side, ia[2] returns the last row in ia. It does not fetch an element from that array but returns the array itself. We subscript that array, fetching element [3], which is the last element in that array. 
Similarly, the right-hand operand has three dimensions. We first fetch the array at index 0 from the outermost array. The result of that operation is a (multidimensional) array of size 20. We take the first element from that 20-element array, yielding an array of size 30. We then fetch the first element from that array. 
In the second example, we define row as a reference to an array of four ints. We bind that reference to the second row in ia. 
As another example, it is common to use a pair of nested for loops to process the elements in a multidimensional array: 
constexpr size_t rowCnt = 3, colCnt = 4; int ia[rowCnt][colCnt]; // 12 uninitialized elements // for each row for (size_t i = 0; i != rowCnt; ++i) { 
// for each column within the row 
for (size_t j = 0; j != colCnt; ++j) { // assign the element's positional index as its value ia[i][j] = i * colCnt + j; 
} } 
The outer for loops through each of the array elements in ia. The inner for loops through the elements of those interior arrays. In this case, we set the value of each element as its index in the overall array. 
Using a Range for with Multidimensional Arrays 

Under the new standard we can simplify the previous loop by using a range for: 
size_t cnt = 0; 
for (auto &row : ia) // for every element in the outer array 
for (auto &col : row) { // for every element in the inner array 
col = cnt; // give this element the next value 
++cnt; // increment cnt 
} 
This loop gives the elements of ia the same values as the previous loop, but this time we let the system manage the indices for us. We want to change the value of the elements, so we declare our control variables, row and col, as references (¬ß 3.2.3, p. 93). The first for iterates through the elements in ia. Those elements are arrays of size 4. Thus, the type of row is a reference to an array of four ints. The second for iterates through one of those 4-element arrays. Hence, col is int&. On each iteration we assign the value of cnt to the next element in ia and increment cnt. 
In the previous example, we used references as our loop control variables because we wanted to change the elements in the array. However, there is a deeper reason for using references. As an example, consider the following loop: 
for (const auto &row : ia) // for every element in the outer array for (auto col : row) // for every element in the inner array cout << col << endl; 
This loop does not write to the elements, yet we still define the control variable of the outer loop as a reference. We do so in order to avoid the normal array to pointer conversion (¬ß 3.5.3, 
p. 117). Had we neglected the reference and written these loops as: 
for (auto row : ia) for (auto col : row) 
our program would not compile. As before, the first for iterates through ia, whose elements are arrays of size 4. Because row is not a reference, when the compiler initializes row it will convert each array element (like any other object of array type) to a pointer to that array's first element. As a result, in this loop the type of row is int*. The inner for loop is illegal. Despite our intentions, that loop attempts to iterate over an int*. 

Note 
To use a multidimensional array in a range for, the loop control variable for all but the innermost array must be references. 
Pointers and Multidimensional Arrays 
As with any array, when we use the name of a multidimensional array, it is automatically converted to a pointer to the first element in the array. 

Note 
When you define a pointer to a multidimensional array, remember that a multidimensional array is really an array of arrays. 
Because a multidimensional array is really an array of arrays, the pointer type to which the array converts is a pointer to the first inner array: 
int ia[3][4]; // array of size 3; each element is an array of ints of size 4 int (*p)[4] = ia; // p points to an array of four ints p = &ia[2]; // p now points to the last element in ia 
Applying the strategy from ¬ß 3.5.1 
(p. 115), we start by noting that (*p) says p is a pointer. Looking right, we see that the object to which p points has a dimension of size 4, and looking left that the element type is int. Hence, p is a pointer to an array of four ints. 

Note 
The parentheses in this declaration are essential: 
int *ip[4]; // array of pointers to int int (*ip)[4]; // pointer to an array of four ints 
With the advent of the new standard, we can often avoid having to write the type of a pointer into an array by using auto or decltype (¬ß 2.5.2, p. 68): 

// print the value of each element in ia, with each inner array on its own line // p points to an array of four ints for (auto p=ia;p != ia + 3; ++p){ 
// q points to the first element of an array of four ints; that is, q points to an int 
for (auto q =*p;q!= *p +4; ++q) cout << *q << ' '; cout << endl; } 
The outer for loop starts by initializing p to point to the first array in ia. That loop continues until we've processed all three rows in ia. The increment, ++p, has the effect of moving p to point to the next row (i.e., the next element) in ia. 
The inner for loop prints the values of the inner arrays. It starts by making q point to the first element in the array to which p points. The result of *p is an array of four ints. As usual, when we use an array, it is converted automatically to a pointer to its first element. The inner for loop runs until we've processed every element in the inner array. To obtain a pointer just off the end of the inner array, we again dereference p to get a pointer to the first element in that array. We then add 4 to that pointer to process the four elements in each inner array. 
Of course, we can even more easily write this loop using the library begin and end functions (¬ß 3.5.3, p. 118): 
// p points to the first array in ia 
for (auto p = begin(ia); p != end(ia); ++p) { // q points to the first element in an inner array for (auto q = begin(*p); q != end(*p); ++q) 
cout << *q << ''; // prints the int value to which q points 
cout << endl; } 
Here we let the library determine the end pointer, and we use auto to avoid having to write the type returned from begin. In the outer loop, that type is a pointer to an array of four ints. In the inner loop, that type is a pointer to int. 
Type Aliases Simplify Pointers to Multidimensional Arrays 
A type alias (¬ß 2.5.1, p. 67) can make it easier to read, write, and understand pointers to multidimensional arrays. For example: 
using int_array = int[4]; // new style type alias declaration; see ¬ß 2.5.1 (p. 68) typedef int int_array[4]; // equivalent typedef declaration; ¬ß 2.5.1 (p. 67) // print the value of each element in ia, with each inner array on its own line 
for (int_array *p = ia; p != ia + 3; ++p) { for (int *q =*p;q!= *p +4; ++q) cout << *q << ' '; cout << endl; } 
Here we start by defining int_array as a name for the type 'array of four ints.¬ß We use that type name to define our loop control variable in the outer for loop. 
Exercises Section 3.6 Exercise 3.43: Write three different versions of a program to print the elements of ia. One version should use a range for to manage the iteration, the other two should use an ordinary for loop in one case using subscripts and in the other using pointers. In all three programs write all the types directly. That is, do not use a type alias, auto, or decltype to simplify the code. 
Exercise 3.44: Rewrite the programs from the previous exercises using a type alias for the type of the loop control variables. 
Exercise 3.45: Rewrite the programs again, this time using auto. 
Chapter Summary 
Among the most important library types are vector and string. A string is a variable-length sequence of characters, and a vector is a container of objects of a single type. 
Iterators allow indirect access to objects stored in a container. Iterators are used to access and navigate between the elements in strings and vectors. 
Arrays and pointers to array elements provide low-level analogs to the vector and string libraries. In general, the library classes should be used in preference to low-level array and pointer alternatives built into the language.

Summary 

Defined 
Terms 
C++ provides a rich set of operators and defines what these operators do when applied to operands of built-in type. It also allows us to define the meaning of most of the operators when applied to operands of class types. This chapter focuses on the operators as defined in the language and applied to operands of built-in type. We will also look at some of the operators defined by the library. Chapter 
14 
will show how we can define operators for our own types. 
An expression is composed of one or more operands 
and yields a result 
when it is evaluated. The simplest form of an expression 
is a single literal or variable. The result of such an expression is the value of the variable or literal. More complicated expressions are formed from an operator 
and one or more operands. 
4.1. Fundamentals 
There are a few fundamental concepts that affect how expressions are evaluated. We start by briefly discussing the concepts that apply to most (if not all) expressions. Subsequent sections will cover these topics in more detail. 
4.1.1. Basic Concepts 

There are both unary 
operators 
and binary 
operators. Unary operators, such as address-of (&) and dereference (*), act on one operand. Binary operators, such as equality (==) and multiplication (*), act on two operands. There is also one ternary operator that takes three operands, and one operator, function call, that takes an unlimited number of operands. 
Some symbols, such as *, are used as both a unary (dereference) and a binary (multiplication) operator. The context in which a symbol is used determines whether the symbol represents a unary or binary operator. The uses of such symbols are independent; it can be helpful to think of them as two different symbols. 

Grouping Operators and Operands 
Understanding expressions with multiple operators requires understanding the precedence 
and associativity 
of the operators and may depend on the order 
of 
evaluation 
of the operands. For example, the result of the following expression depends on how the operands are grouped to the operators: 
5 + 10 * 20/2; The operands to the * operator could be 10 and 20, or 10 and 20/2, or 15 and 20, or 15 and 20/2. Understanding such expressions is the topic of the next section. 

Operand Conversions 
As part of evaluating an expression, operands are often converted from one type to another. For example, the binary operators usually expect operands with the same type. These operators can be used on operands with differing types so long as the operands can be converted (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 35) to a common type. 
Although the rules are somewhat complicated, for the most part conversions happen in unsurprising ways. For example, we can convert an integer to floating-point, and vice versa, but we cannot convert a pointer type to floating-point. What may be a bit surprising is that small integral type operands (e.g., bool, char, short, etc.) are generally promoted 
to a larger integral type, typically int. We'll look in detail at conversions in ¬ß 4.11 
(p. 159). 

Overloaded Operators 
The language defines what the operators mean when applied to built-in and compound types. We can also define what most operators mean when applied to class types. Because such definitions give an alternative meaning to an existing operator symbol, we refer to them as overloaded 
operators. The IO library >> and << operators and the operators we used with strings, vectors, and iterators are all overloaded operators. 
When we use an overloaded operator, the meaning of the operator'including the type of its operand(s) and the result' depend on how the operator is defined. However, the number of operands and the precedence and the associativity of the operator cannot be changed. 
Lvalues and Rvalues 

Every expression in C++ is either an rvalue 
(pronounced 'are.value') or an lvalue 
(pronounced 'ell-value'). These names are inherited from C and originally had a simple mnemonic purpose: lvalues could stand on the left-hand side of an assignment whereas rvalues could not. 
In C++, the distinction is less simple. In C++, an lvalue expression yields an object or a function. However, some lvalues, such as const objects, may not be the left-hand operand of an assignment. Moreover, some expressions yield objects but return them as rvalues, not lvalues. Roughly speaking, when we use an object as an rvalue, we use the object's value (its contents). When we use an object as an lvalue, we use the object's identity (its location in memory). 
Operators differ as to whether they require lvalue or rvalue operands and as to whether they return lvalues or rvalues. The important point is that (with one exception that we'll cover in ¬ß 
13.6 
(p. 531)) we can use an lvalue when an rvalue is required, but we cannot use an rvalue when an lvalue (i.e., a location) is required. When we use an lvalue in place of an rvalue, the object's contents (its value) are used. We have already used several operators that involve lvalues. 
. 
Assignment requires a (nonconst) lvalue as its left-hand operand and yields its left-hand operand as an lvalue. 

. 
The address-of operator (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 52) requires an lvalue operand and returns a pointer to its operand as an rvalue. 

. 
The built-in dereference and subscript operators (¬ß 2.3.2, 

p. 53, and ¬ß 3.5.2, p. 116) and the iterator dereference and string and vector subscript operators (¬ß 3.4.1, p. 106, ¬ß 3.2.3, p. 93, and ¬ß 3.3.3, p. 102) all yield lvalues. 

. 
The built-in and iterator increment and decrement operators (¬ß 1.4.1, p. 12, and ¬ß 3.4.1, p. 107) require lvalue operands and the prefix versions (which are the ones we have used so far) also yield lvalues. 


As we present the operators, we will note whether an operand must be an lvalue and whether the operator returns an lvalue. 
Lvalues and rvalues also differ when used with decltype (¬ß 2.5.3, p. 70). When we apply decltype to an expression (other than a variable), the result is a reference type if the expression yields an lvalue. As an example, assume p is an int*. Because dereference yields an lvalue, decltype(*p) is int&. On the other hand, because the address-of operator yields an rvalue, decltype(&p) is int**, that is, a pointer to a pointer to type int. 
4.1.2. Precedence and Associativity 

An 
expression 
with 
two 
or 
more 
operators 
is 
a 
compound 
expression. 
Evaluating 
a 
compound 
expression 
involves 
grouping the operands to the operators. Precedence and associativity determine how the operands are grouped. That is, they determine which parts of the expression are the operands for each of the operators in the expression. Programmers can override these rules by parenthesizing compound expressions to force a particular grouping. 
In general, the value of an expression depends on how the subexpressions are grouped. Operands of operators with higher precedence group more tightly than operands of operators at lower precedence. Associativity determines how to group operands with the same precedence. For example, multiplication and division have the same precedence as each other, but they have higher precedence than addition. Therefore, operands to multiplication and division group before operands to addition and subtraction. The arithmetic operators are left associative, which means operators at the same precdence group left to right: 
. 
Because of precedence, the expression 3+4*5 is 23, not 35. 

. 
Because of associativity, the expression 20-15-3 is 2, not 8. 


As a more complicated example, a left-to-right evaluation of the following expression yields 20: 
6+3*4/2+2 
Other imaginable results include 9, 14, and 36. In C++, the result is 14, because this expression is equivalent to 
// parentheses in this expression match default precedence and associativity 
((6 +((3 * 4) /2)) + 2) 

Parentheses Override Precedence and Associativity 
We can override the normal grouping with parentheses. Parenthesized expressions are evaluated by treating each parenthesized subexpression as a unit and otherwise applying the normal precedence rules. For example, we can parenthesize the expression above to force the result to be any of the four possible values: 
// parentheses result in alternative groupings 
cout << (6 +3) * (4 /2+2) << endl; // prints 36 
cout << ((6 +3) * 4) /2+2<< endl; // prints 20 
cout << 6+3*4 /(2 +2) << endl; // prints 9 
When Precedence and Associativity Matter 

We have already seen examples where precedence affects the correctness of our programs. For example, consider the discussion in ¬ß 3.5.3 
(p. 120) about dereference and pointer arithmetic: 
int ia[] = {0,2,4,6,8}; // array with five elements of type int int last = *(ia + 4); // initializes last to 8, the value of ia [4] last =*ia +4; // last = 4, equivalent to ia [0] + 4 
If we want to access the element at the location ia+4, then the parentheses around the addition are essential. Without parentheses, *ia is grouped first and 4 is added to the value in *ia. 
The most common case that we've seen in which associativity matters is in input and output expressions. As we'll see in ¬ß 4.8 

(p. 155), the operators used for IO are left associative. This associativity means we can combine several IO operations in a single expression: 
cin >> v1 >> v2; // read into v1 and then into v2 
Table 4.12 (p. 166) lists all the operators organized into segments separated by double lines. Operators in each segment have the same precedence, and have higher precedence than operators in subsequent segments. For example, the prefix increment and dereference operators share the same precedence, which is higher than that of the arithmetic operators. The table includes a page reference to each operator's description. We have seen some of these operators already and will cover most of the rest in this chapter. However, there are a few operators that we will not cover until later. 
Exercises Section 4.1.2 
Exercise 4.1: What is the value returned by 5 + 10 * 20/2? Exercise 4.2: Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize 
the following expressions to indicate the order in which the operands are grouped: 
(a) 
* vec.begin() 

(b) 
* vec.begin() + 1 


4.1.3. Order of Evaluation 

Precedence specifies how the operands are grouped. It says nothing about the order in which the operands are evaluated. In most cases, the order is largely unspecified. In the following expression 
int i = f1() * f2(); 
we know that f1 and f2 must be called before the multiplication can be done. After all, it is their results that are multiplied. However, we have no way of knowing whether f1 will be called before f2 or vice versa. 
For operators that do not specify evaluation order, it is an error for an expression to refer to and change the same object. Expressions that do so have undefined behavior (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 36). As a simple example, the << operator makes no guarantees about when or how its operands are evaluated. As a result, the following output expression is undefined: 
int i= 0; 
cout << i << " "<< ++i << endl; // undefined 
Because this program is undefined, we cannot draw any conclusions about how it might behave. The compiler might evaluate ++i before evaluating i, in which case the output will be 11. Or the compiler might evaluate i first, in which case the output will be 01. Or the compiler might do something else entirely. Because this expression has undefined behavior, the program is in error, regardless of what code the compiler generates. 
There are four operators that do guarantee the order in which operands are evaluated. We saw in ¬ß 3.2.3 
(p. 94) that the logical AND (&&) operator guarantees that its left-hand operand is evaluated first. Moreover, we are also guaranteed that the right-hand operand is evaluated only if the left-hand operand is true. The only other operators that guarantee the order in which operands are evaluated are the logical OR (||) operator (¬ß 4.3, 
p. 141), the conditional (?:) operator (¬ß 4.7, p. 151), and the comma (,) operator (¬ß 4.10, p. 157). 

Order of Evaluation, Precedence, and Associativity 

Order of operand evaluation is independent of precedence and associativity. In an expression such as f() +g() * h() + j(): 
. 
Precedence guarantees that the results of g() and h() are multiplied. 

. 
Associativity guarantees that the result of f() is added to the product of g() and h() and that the result of that addition is added to the value of j(). 

. 
There are no guarantees as to the order in which these 


functions are called. If f, g, h, and j are independent functions that do not affect the state of the same objects or perform IO, then the order in which the functions are called is irrelevant. If any of these functions do affect the same object, then the expression is in error and has undefined behavior. 
Exercises Section 4.1.3 Exercise 4.3: Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not? 
Advice: Managing Compound Expressions When you write compound expressions, two rules of thumb can be helpful: 
1. 
When in doubt, parenthesize expressions to force the grouping that the logic of your program requires. 

2. 
If you change the value of an operand, don't use that 


operand elsewhere in the same expresion. An important exception to the second rule occurs when the subexpression that changes the operand is itself the operand of another subexpression. For example, in *++iter, the increment changes the value of iter. The (now changed) value of iter is the operand to the dereference operator. In this (and similar) expressions, order of evaluation isn't an issue. The increment (i.e., the subexpression that changes the operand) must be evaluated before the dereference can be evaluated. Such usage poses no problems and is quite common. 
4.2. Arithmetic Operators 
Table 
4.1 
(and the operator tables in subsequent sections) groups the operators by their precedence. The unary arithmetic operators have higher precedence than the multiplication and division operators, which in turn have higher precedence than the binary addition and subtraction operators. Operators of higher precedence group more tightly than do operators with lower precedence. These operators are all left associative, meaning that they group left to right when the precedence levels are the same. 

Unless noted otherwise, the arithmetic operators may be applied to any of the arithmetic types (¬ß 2.1.1, p. 32) or to any type that can be converted to an arithmetic type. The operands and results of these operators are rvalues. As described in ¬ß 
4.11 
(p. 159), operands of small integral types are promoted to a larger integral type, and all operands may be converted to a common type as part of evaluating these operators. 
The unary plus operator and the addition and subtraction operators may also be applied to pointers. ¬ß 3.5.3 
(p. 119) covered the use of binary + and -with pointer operands. When applied to a pointer or arithmetic value, unary plus returns a (possibly promoted) copy of the value of its operand. 
The unary minus operator returns the result of negating a (possibly promoted) copy of the value of its operand: 
int i = 1024; 
int k= -i; // i is -1024 
bool b = true; 
bool b2 = -b; // b2 is true! 
In ¬ß 2.1.1 
(p. 34) we noted that bool values should not be used for computation. The result of -b is a good example of what we had in mind. 
For most operators, operands of type bool are promoted to int. In this case, the value of b is true, which promotes to the int value 1 (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 35). That (promoted) value is negated, yielding -1. The value -1 is converted back to bool and used to initialize b2. This initializer is a nonzero value, which when converted to bool is true. Thus, the value of b2 is true! 
Caution: Overflow and Other Arithmetic Exceptions 
Some arithmetic expressions yield undefined results. Some of these undefined expressions are due to the nature of mathematics'for example, division by zero. Others are undefined due to the nature of computers' for example, due to overflow. Overflow happens when a value is computed that is outside the range of values that the type can represent. 
Consider a machine on which shorts are 16 bits. In that case, the maximum short is 32767. On such a machine, the following compound assignment overflows: 
short short_value = 32767; // max value if shorts are 16 bits short_value += 1; // this calculation overflows cout << "short_value: " << short_value << endl; 
The assignment to short_value is undefined. Representing a signed value of 32768 requires 17 bits, but only 16 are available. On many systems, there is no compile-time or run-time warning when an overflow occurs. As with any undefined behavior, what happens is unpredictable. On our system the program completes and writes 
short_value: -32768 
The value 'wrapped around': The sign bit, which had been 0, was set to 1, resulting in a negative value. On another system, the result might be different, or the program might behave differently, including crashing entirely. 
When applied to objects of arithmetic types, the arithmetic operators, +, -, *, and /, have their obvious meanings: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Division between integers returns an integer. If the quotient contains a fractional part, it is truncated toward zero: 
int ival1 = 21/6; // ival1 is 3; result is truncated; remainder is discarded int ival2 = 21/7; // ival2 is 3; no remainder; result is an integral value 
The % operator, known as the 'remainder' or the 'modulus' operator, computes the remainder that results from dividing the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand. The operands to % must have integral type: 
int ival = 42; 
double dval = 3.14; 
ival % 12; // ok: result is 6 
ival % dval; // error: floating-point operand 
In a division, a nonzero quotient is positive if the operands have the same sign and negative otherwise. Earlier versions of the language permitted a negative quotient to be rounded up or down; the new standard requires the quotient to be rounded toward zero (i.e., truncated). 

The modulus operator is defined so that if m and n are integers and n is nonzero, then (m/n)*n + m%n is equal to m. By implication, if m%n is nonzero, it has the same sign as m. Earlier versions of the language permitted m%n to have the same sign as n on implementations in which negative m/n was rounded away from zero, but such implementations are now prohibited. Moreover, except for the obscure case where -m overflows, (.m)/n and m/(-n) are always equal to -(m/n), m%(-n) is equal to m%n, and (-m)%n is equal to -(m%n). More concretely: 
21 %6; /* result is 3 */ 21 /6; /* result is 3 */ 21 %7; /* result is 0 */ 21 /7; /* result is 3 */ -21 %-8; /* result is -5 */ -21 /-8; /* result is 2 */ 21 %-5; /* result is 1 */ 21 /-5; /* result is -4 */

4.3. Logical and Relational Operators 
The relational operators take operands of arithmetic or pointer type; the logical operators take operands of any type that can be converted to bool. These operators all return values of type bool. Arithmetic and pointer operand(s) with a value of zero are false; all other values are true. The operands to these operators are rvalues and the result is an rvalue. 

Logical AND and OR Operators 
The overall result of the logical AND operator is true if and only if both its operands evaluate to true. The logical OR (||) operator evaluates as true if either of its operands evaluates as true. 
The logical AND and OR operators always evaluate their left operand before the right. Moreover, the right operand is evaluated if and only if the left operand does not determine the result. This strategy is known as short-circuit 
evaluation: 
. 
The right side of an && is evaluated if and only if the left side is true. 

. 
The right side of an || is evaluated if and only if the left side is false. 


Several of the programs in Chapter 
3 
used the logical AND operator. Those programs used the left-hand operand to test whether it was safe to evaluate the right-hand operand. For example, the for condition on page 94: 
index != s.size() && !isspace(s[index]) 
first checks that index has not reached the end of its associated string. We're guaranteed that the right operand won't be evaluated unless index is in range. 
As an example that uses the logical OR, imagine we have some text in a vector of strings. We want to print the strings, adding a newline after each empty string or after a string that ends with a period. We'll use a range-based for loop (¬ß 3.2.3, p. 
91) to process each element: 
// note s as a reference to const; the elements aren't copied and can't be 
changed 
for (const auto &s : text) { // for each element in text 
cout << s; // print the current element 
// blank lines and those that end with a period get a newline 
if (s.empty() || s[s.size() -1] == '.') 
cout << endl; else cout << ""; // otherwise just separate with a space } 
After we print the current element, we check to see if we need to print a newline. The condition in the if first checks whether s is an empty string. If so, we need to print a newline regardless of the value of the right-hand operand. Only if the string is not empty do we evaluate the second expression, which checks whether the string ends with a period. In this expression, we rely on short-circuit evaluation of || to ensure that we subscript s only if s is not empty. 
It is worth noting that we declared s as a reference to const (¬ß 2.5.2, p. 69). The elements in text are strings, and might be large. By making s a reference, we avoid copying the elements. Because we don't need to write to the elements, we made s a reference to const. 
Logical NOT Operator 
The logical NOT operator (!) returns the inverse of the truth value of its operand. We first used this operator in ¬ß 3.2.2 
(p. 87). As another example, assuming vec is a vector of ints, we might use the logical NOT operator to see whether vec has elements by negating the value returned by empty: 
// print the first element in vec if there is one 
if (!vec.empty()) cout << vec[0]; The subexpression 
!vec.empty() evaluates as true if the call to empty returns false. 
The Relational Operators 
The relational operators (<, <=, >, <=) have their ordinary meanings and return bool values. These operators are left associative. 
Because the relational operators return bools, the result of chaining these operators together is likely to be surprising: 
// oops! this condition compares k to the bool result of i < j 
if(i <j <k) // true if k is greater than 1! 
This condition groups i and j to the first < operator. The bool result of that expression is the left-hand operand of the second less-than operator. That is, k is compared to the true/false result of the first comparison! To accomplish the test we intended, we can rewrite the expression as follows: 
// ok: condition is true if i is smaller than j and j is smaller than k 
if(i <j&&j <k){/* ... */} 
Equality Tests and the bool Literals 
If we want to test the truth value of an arithmetic or pointer object, the most direct way is to use the value as a condition: 
if (val) {/* ... */ }// true if val is any nonzero value 
if(!val){/* ... */}// true if val is zero In both conditions, the compiler converts val to bool. The first condition succeeds so long as val is nonzero; the second succeeds if val is zero. 
We might think we could rewrite a test of this kind as 
if (val == true) {/* ... */ }// true only if val is equal to 1! 
There are two problems with this approach. First, it is longer and less direct than the previous code (although admittedly when first learning C++ this kind of abbreviation can be perplexing). Much more importantly, when val is not a bool, this comparison does not work as expected. 
If val is not a bool, then true is converted to the type of val before the == operator is applied. That is, when val is not a bool, it is as if we had written 
if (val == 1) {/* ... */ } As we've seen, when a bool is converted to another arithmetic type, false converts to 0 and true converts to 1 (¬ß 2.1.2, p. 35). If we really cared whether val was the specific value 1, we should write the condition to test that case directly. 

Warning 
It is usually a bad idea to use the boolean literals true 
and false as operands in a comparison. These literals should be used only to compare to an object of type bool.

Exercise 4.12: Assuming i, j, and k are all ints, explain what i!= j < k means. 
4.4. Assignment Operators 
The left-hand operand of an assignment operator must be a modifiable lvalue. For example, given 
int i= 0, j = 0, k = 0; // initializations, not assignment const int ci = i; // initialization, not assignment 
Each of these assignments is illegal: 
1024 =k; // error: literals are rvalues i+j=k; // error: arithmetic expressions are rvalues ci =k; // error: ci is a const (nonmodifiable) lvalue 
The result of an assignment is its left-hand operand, which is an lvalue. The type of the result is the type of the left-hand operand. If the types of the left and right operands differ, the right-hand operand is converted to the type of the left: 
k=0; // result: type int, value 0 k = 3.14159; // result: type int, value 3 
Under the new standard, we can use a braced initializer list (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43) on the right-hand side: 

k = {3.14}; // error: narrowing conversion vector<int> vi; // initially empty vi = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; // vi now has ten elements, values 0 through 9 
If the left-hand operand is of a built-in type, the initializer list may contain at most one value, and that value must not require a narrowing conversion (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43). 
For class types, what happens depends on the details of the class. In the case of vector, the vector template defines its own version of an assignment operator that can take an initializer list. This operator replaces the elements of the left-hand side with the elements in the list on the right-hand side. 
Regardless of the type of the left-hand operand, the initializer list may be empty. In this case, the compiler generates a value-initialized (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 98) temporary and assigns that value to the left-hand operand. 
Assignment Is Right Associative 
Unlike the other binary operators, assignment is right associative: 
int ival, jval; 
ival =jval = 0; // ok: each assigned 0 
Because assignment is right associative, the right-most assignment, jval = 0, is the right-hand operand of the left-most assignment operator. Because assignment returns its left-hand operand, the result of the right-most assignment (i.e., jval) is assigned to ival. 
Each object in a multiple assignment must have the same type as its right-hand neighbor or a type to which that neighbor can be converted (¬ß 4.11, p. 159): 
int ival, *pval; // ival is an int; pval is a pointer to int 
ival =pval =0; // error: cannot assign the value of a pointer to an int 
string s1, s2; 
s1 =s2 ="OK"; // string literal "OK" converted to string 
The first assignment is illegal because ival and pval have different types and there is no conversion from the type of pval (int*) to the type of ival (int). It is illegal even though zero is a value that can be assigned to either object. 
On the other hand, the second assignment is fine. The string literal is converted to string, and that string is assigned to s2. The result of that assignment is s2, which has the same type as 
s1. 
Assignment Has Low Precedence 
Assignments often occur in conditions. Because assignment has relatively low precedence, we usually must parenthesize the assignment for the condition to work properly. To see why assignment in a condition is useful, consider the following loop. We want to call a function until it returns a desired value'say, 42: 
// a verbose and therefore more error-prone way to write this loop 
int i = get_value(); // get the first value 
while (i != 42) { 
// do something ... i = get_value(); // get remaining values } 
Here we start by calling get_value followed by a loop whose condition uses the value returned from that call. The last statement in this loop makes another call to get_value, and the loop repeats. We can write this code more directly as 
int i; 
// a better way to write our loop---what the condition does is now clearer 
while ((i = get_value()) != 42) { 
// do something ... } 
The condition now more clearly expresses our intent: We want to continue until get_value returns 42. The condition executes by assigning the result returned by get_value to i and then comparing the result of that assignment with 42. 
Without the parentheses, the operands to != would be the value returned from get_value and 42. The true or false result of that test would be assigned to i'clearly not what we intended! 


Note 
Because assignment has lower precedence than the relational operators, parentheses are usually needed around assignments in conditions. 
Beware of Confusing Equality and Assignment Operators 
The fact that we can use assignment in a condition can have surprising effects: 
if (i = j) The condition in this if assigns the value of j to i and then tests the result of the assignment. If j is nonzero, the condition will be true. The author of this code almost surely intended to test whether i and j have the same value: 
if (i == j) 
Bugs of this sort are notoriously difficult to find. Some, but not all, compilers are kind enough to warn about code such as this example. 
Compound Assignment Operators 
We often apply an operator to an object and then assign the result to that same object. As an example, consider the sum program from ¬ß 1.4.2 
(p. 13): 
int sum = 0; 
// sum values from 1 through 10 inclusive 
for (int val = 1; val <= 10; ++val) sum += val; // equivalent to sum = sum + val 
This kind of operation is common not just for addition but for the other arithmetic operators and the bitwise operators, which we cover in ¬ß 4.8 
(p. 152). There are compound assignments for each of these operators: 
+= -= *= /= %= // arithmetic operators <<= >>= &= ^= |= // bitwise operators; see ¬ß 4.8 (p. 152) 
Each compound operator is essentially equivalent to 
a=a op b; 
with the exception that, when we use the compound assignment, the left-hand operand is evaluated only once. If we use an ordinary assignment, that operand is evaluated twice: once in the expression on the right-hand side and again as the operand on the left hand. In many, perhaps most, contexts this difference is immaterial aside from possible performance consequences. 
Exercises Section 4.4 Exercise 4.13: What are the values of i and d after each assignment? 
int i; double d; 
(a) 
d= i = 3.5; 

(b) 
i = d = 3.5; 


Exercise 4.14: Explain what happens in each of the if tests: 
if (42 =i) // ... if (i =42) // ... 
Exercise 4.15: The following assignment is illegal. Why? How would you correct it? 
double dval; int ival; int *pi; dval =ival = pi = 0; 
Exercise 4.16: Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be. 
(a) 
if (p = getPtr() != 0) 

(b) 
if (i = 1024) 


4.5. Increment and Decrement Operators 
The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators provide a convenient notational shorthand for adding or subtracting 1 from an object. This notation rises above mere convenience when we use these operators with iterators, because many iterators do not support arithmetic. 
There are two forms of these operators: prefix and postfix. So far, we have used only the prefix form. This form increments (or decrements) its operand and yields the changed object as its result. The postfix operators increment (or decrement) the operand but yield a copy of the original, unchanged value as its result: 
int i= 0, j; 
j = ++i; // j = 1, i = 1: prefix yields the incremented value 
j = i++; // j = 1, i = 2: postfix yields the unincremented value 
These operators require lvalue operands. The prefix operators return the object itself as an lvalue. The postfix operators return a copy of the object's original value as an rvalue. 
Advice: Use Postfix Operators only When Necessary 
Readers from a C background might be surprised that we use the prefix increment in the programs we've written. The reason is simple: The prefix version avoids unnecessary work. It increments the value and returns the incremented version. The postfix operator must store the original value so that it can return the unincremented value as its result. If we don't need the unincremented value, there's no need for the extra work done by the postfix operator. 
For ints and pointers, the compiler can optimize away this extra work. For more complicated iterator types, this extra work potentially might be more costly. By habitually using the prefix versions, we do not have to worry about whether the performance difference matters. Moreover'and perhaps more importantly'we can express the intent of our programs more directly. 
Combining Dereference and Increment in a Single Expression 

The postfix versions of ++ and --are used when we want to use the current value of a variable and increment it in a single compound expression. 
As one example, we can use postfix increment to write a loop to print the values in a vector up to but not including the first negative value: 
auto pbeg = v.begin(); 
// print elements up to the first negative value 
while (pbeg != v.end() && *beg >= 0) 
cout << *pbeg++ << endl; // print the current value and advance pbeg 
The expression *pbeg++ is usually confusing to programmers new to both C++ and C. However, because this usage pattern is so common, C++ programmers must understand such expressions. 
The precedence of postfix increment is higher than that of the dereference operator, so *pbeg++ is equivalent to *(pbeg++). The subexpression pbeg++ increments pbeg and yields a copy of the previous value of pbeg as its result. Accordingly, the operand of * is the unincremented value of pbeg. Thus, the statement prints the element to which pbeg originally pointed and increments pbeg. 
This usage relies on the fact that postfix increment returns a copy of its original, unincremented operand. If it returned the incremented value, we'd dereference the incremented value, with disastrous results. We'd skip the first element. Worse, if the sequence had no negative values, we would attempt to dereference one too many elements. 
Advice: Brevity Can Be a Virtue 
Expressions such as *pbeg++ can be bewildering'at first. However, it is a useful and widely used idiom. Once the notation is familiar, writing 
cout << *iter++ << endl; 
is easier and less error-prone than the more verbose equivalent 
cout << *iter << endl; ++iter; 
It is worthwhile to study examples of such code until their meanings are immediately clear. Most C++ programs use succinct expressions rather than more verbose equivalents. Therefore, C++ programmers must be comfortable with such usages. Moreover, once these expressions are familiar, you will find them less error-prone. 
Remember That Operands Can Be Evaluated in Any Order 
Most operators give no guarantee as to the order in which operands will be evaluated (¬ß 4.1.3, p. 137). This lack of guaranteed order often doesn't matter. The cases where it does matter are when one subexpression changes the value of an operand that is used in another subexpression. Because the increment and decrement operators change their operands, it is easy to misuse these operators in compound expressions. 
To illustrate the problem, we'll rewrite the loop from ¬ß 3.4.1 

(p. 108) that capitalizes the first word in the input. That example used a for loop: 
for (auto it = s.begin(); it != s.end() && !isspace(*it); ++it) *it = toupper(*it); // capitalize the current character 
which allowed us to separate the statement that dereferenced beg from the one that incremented it. Replacing the for with a seemingly equivalent while 
// the behavior of the following loop is undefined! while (beg != s.end() && !isspace(*beg)) *beg = toupper(*beg++); // error: this assignment is undefined 
results in undefined behavior. The problem is that in the revised version, both the left-and right-hand operands to = use beg and the right-hand operand changes beg. The assignment is therefore undefined. The compiler might evaluate this expression as either 
*beg = toupper(*beg); // execution if left-hand side is evaluated first *(beg + 1) = toupper(*beg); // execution if right-hand side is evaluated first 
or it might evaluate it in yet some other way. 
Exercises Section 4.5 
Exercise 4.17: Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment. Exercise 4.18: What would happen if the while loop on 
page 148 
that prints the elements from a vector used the 
prefix increment operator? Exercise 4.19: Given that ptr points to an int, that vec is a vector<int>, and that ival is an int, explain the behavior of 
each of these expressions. Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect? Why? How might each be corrected? 
(a) 
ptr != 0 && *ptr++ 

(b) 
ival++ && ival 

(c) 
vec[ival++] <= vec[ival] 


4.6. The Member Access Operators 
The dot (¬ß 1.5.2, p. 23) and arrow (¬ß 3.4.1, p. 110) operators provide for member access. The dot operator fetches a member from an object of class type; arrow is defined so that ptr->mem is a synonym for (*ptr).mem: 
string s1 = "a string", *p = &s1; 
auto n = s1.size(); // run the size member of the string s1 
n = (*p).size(); // run size on the object to which p points 
n = p->size(); // equivalent to (*p).size() 
Because dereference has a lower precedence than dot, we must parenthesize the dereference subexpression. If we omit the parentheses, this code means something quite different: 
// run the size member of p, then dereference the result! 
*p.size(); // error: p is a pointer and has no member named size This expression attempts to fetch the size member of the object 
p. However, p is a pointer, which has no members; this code will not compile. 
The arrow operator requires a pointer operand and yields an lvalue. The dot operator yields an lvalue if the object from which the member is fetched is an lvalue; otherwise the result is an rvalue. 
Exercises Section 4.6 Exercise 4.20: Assuming that iter is a vector<string>::iterator, indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and why those that aren't legal are in error. 
(a) 
*iter++; 

(b) 
(*iter)++; 

(c) 
*iter.empty() 

(d) 
iter->empty(); 

(e) 
++*iter; 

(f) 
iter++->empty(); 


4.7. The Conditional Operator 
The conditional operator (the ?: 
operator) lets us embed simple if-else logic inside an expression. The conditional operator has the following form: 
cond ? expr1 : expr2; 
where cond is an expression that is used as a condition and expr1 and expr2 are expressions of the same type (or types that can be converted to a common type). This operator executes by evaluating cond. If the condition is true, then expr1 is evaluated; otherwise, expr2 is evaluated. As one example, we can use a conditional operator to determine whether a grade is pass or fail: 
string finalgrade = (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass"; The condition checks whether grade is less than 60. If so, the result of the expression is "fail"; otherwise the result is "pass". Like the logical AND and logical OR (&& and ||) operators, the conditional operator guarantees that only one of expr1 or expr2 is evaluated. 
That result of the conditional operator is an lvalue if both expressions are lvalues or if they convert to a common lvalue type. Otherwise the result is an rvalue. 
Nesting Conditional Operations 
We can nest one conditional operator inside another. That is, the conditional operator can be used as the cond or as one or both of the exprs of another conditional expression. As an example, we'll use a pair of nested conditionals to perform a three-way test to indicate whether a grade is a high pass, an ordinary pass, or fail: 
finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass" 
: (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass"; The first condition checks whether the grade is above 90. If so, the expression after the ? is evaluated, which yields "high pass". If the condition fails, the : branch is executed, which is itself another conditional expression. This conditional asks whether the grade is less than 60. If so, the ? branch is evaluated and yields "fail". If not, the : branch returns "pass". 
The conditional operator is right associative, meaning (as usual) that the operands group right to left. Associativity accounts for the fact that the right-hand conditional'the one that compares grade to 60'forms the : branch of the left-hand conditional expression. 

Warning 
Nested conditionals quickly become unreadable. It's a good idea to nest no more than two or three. 
Using a Conditional Operator in an Output Expression 
The conditional operator has fairly low precedence. When we embed a conditional expression in a larger expression, we usually must parenthesize the conditional subexpression. For example, we often use the conditional operator to print one or another value, depending on the result of a condition. An incompletely parenthesized conditional operator in an output expression can have surprising results: 
cout << ((grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass"); // prints pass or fail cout << (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass"; // prints 1 or 0! cout << grade < 60 ? "fail" : "pass"; // error: compares cout to 60 
The second expression uses the comparison between grade and 60 as the operand to the << operator. The value 1 or 0 is printed, depending on whether grade < 60 is true or false. The << operator returns cout, which is tested as the condition for the conditional operator. That is, the second expression is equivalent to 
cout << (grade < 60); // prints 1 or 0 
cout ? "fail" : "pass"; // test cout and then yield one of the two 
literals 
// depending on whether cout is true or false 
The last expression is an error because it is equivalent to 
cout << grade; // less-than has lower precedence than shift, so print grade first cout < 60 ? "fail" : "pass"; // then compare cout to 60! 
Exercises Section 4.7 
Exercise 4.21: Write a program to use a conditional operator to find the elements in a vector<int> that have odd value and double the value of each such element. 
Exercise 4.22: Extend the program that assigned high pass, pass, and fail grades to also assign low pass for grades between 60 and 75 inclusive. Write two versions: One version that uses only conditional operators; the other should use one or more if statements. Which version do you think is easier to understand and why? 
Exercise 4.23: The following expression fails to compile due to operator precedence. Using Table 4.12 
(p. 166), explain why it fails. How would you fix it? 
string s = "word"; string pl = s + s[s.size() -1] == 's' ? "" : "s" ; 
Exercise 4.24: Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass, and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right associative. Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator were left associative. 
4.8. The Bitwise Operators 
The bitwise operators take operands of integral type that they use as a collection of bits. These operators let us test and set individual bits. As we'll see in ¬ß 17.2 
(p. 723), we can also use these operators on a library type named bitset that represents a flexibly sized collection of bits. 
As usual, if an operand is a 'small integer,¬ß its value is first promoted (¬ß 4.11.1, p. 160) to a larger integral type. The operand(s) can be either signed or unsigned. 

If the operand is signed and its value is negative, then the way that the 'sign bit' is handled in a number of the bitwise operations is machine dependent. Moreover, doing a left shift that changes the value of the sign bit is undefined. 

Warning 
Because there are no guarantees for how the sign bit is handled, we strongly recommend using unsigned types with the bitwise operators. 
Bitwise Shift Operators 
We have already used the overloaded versions of the >> and << operators that the IO library defines to do input and output. The built-in meaning of these operators is that they perform a bitwise shift on their operands. They yield a value that is a copy of the (possibly promoted) left-hand operand with the bits shifted as directed by the right-hand operand. The right-hand operand must not be negative and must be a value that is strictly less than the number of bits in the result. Otherwise, the operation is undefined. The bits are shifted left (<<) or right (>>). Bits that are shifted off the end are discarded: 

The left-shift operator (the << 
operator) inserts 0-valued bits on 
the 
right. 
The 
behavior 
of 
the 
right-shift 
operator 
(the 
>> 
operator) 
depends 
on 
the 
type 
of 
the 
left-hand 
operand: 
If 
that operand is unsigned, then the operator inserts 0-valued bits on the left; if it is a signed type, the result is implementation defined'either copies of the sign bit or 0-valued bits are inserted on the left. 
Bitwise NOT Operator 
The bitwise NOT operator (the ~ 
operator) generates a new value with the bits of its operand inverted. Each 1 bit is set to 0; each 0 bit is set to 1: 

Here, our char operand is first promoted to int. Promoting a char to int leaves the value unchanged but adds 0 bits to the high order positions. Thus, promoting bits to int adds 24 high order bits, all of which are 0-valued. The bits in the promoted value are inverted. 
Bitwise AND, OR, and XOR Operators 
The AND (&), OR (|), and XOR (^) operators generate new values with the bit pattern composed from its two operands: 

For each bit position in the result of the bitwise AND operator (the & 
operator) the bit is 1 if both operands contain 1; otherwise, the result is 0. For the OR (inclusive or) operator (the | operator), the bit is 1 if either or both operands contain 1; otherwise, the result is 0. For the XOR (exclusive or) operator (the ^ 
operator), the bit is 1 if either but not both operands contain 1; otherwise, the result is 0. 

Warning 
It is a common error to confuse the bitwise and logical operators (¬ß 4.3, p. 141). For example to confuse the bitwise & with the logical &&, the bitwise | with the logical ||, and the bitwise ~ and the logical !). 
Using Bitwise Operators 
As an example of using the bitwise operators let's assume a teacher has 30 students in a class. Each week the class is given a pass/fail quiz. We'll track the results of each quiz using one bit per student to represent the pass or fail grade on a given test. We might represent each quiz in an unsigned integral value: 
unsigned long quiz1 = 0; // we'll use this value as a collection of bits 
We define quiz1 as an unsigned long. Thus, quiz1 will have at least 32 bits on any machine. We explicitly initialize quiz1 to ensure that the bits start out with well-defined values. 
The teacher must be able to set and test individual bits. For example, we'd like to be able to set the bit corresponding to student number 27 to indicate that this student passed the quiz. We can indicate that student number 27 passed by creating a value that has only bit 27 turned on. If we then bitwise OR that value with quiz1, all the bits except bit 27 will remain unchanged. 
For the purpose of this example, we will count the bits of quiz1 by assigning 0 to the low-order bit, 1 to the next bit, and so on. 
We can obtain a value indicating that student 27 passed by using the left-shift operator and an unsigned long integer literal 1 (¬ß 2.1.3, p. 38): 
1UL << 27 // generate a value with only bit number 27 set 
1UL has a 1 in the low-order bit and (at least) 31 zero bits. We specified unsigned long because ints are only guaranteed to have 16 bits, and we need at least 17. This expression shifts the 1 bit left 27 positions inserting 0 bits behind it. 
Next we OR this value with quiz1. Because we want to update the value of quiz1, we use a compound assignment (¬ß 4.4, p. 147): 
quiz1 |= 1UL << 27; // indicate student number 27 passed 
The |= operator executes analogously to how += does. It is equivalent to 
quiz1 = quiz1 | 1UL << 27; // equivalent to quiz1 |= 1UL << 27; 
Imagine that the teacher reexamined the quiz and discovered that student 27 actually had failed the test. The teacher must now turn off bit 27. This time we need an integer that has bit 27 turned off and all the other bits turned on. We'll bitwise AND this value with quiz1 to turn off just that bit: 
quiz1 &= ~(1UL << 27); // student number 27 failed 
We obtain a value with all but bit 27 turned on by inverting our previous value. That value had 0 bits in all but bit 27, which was a 1. Applying the bitwise NOT to that value will turn off bit 27 and turn on all the others. When we bitwise AND this value with quiz1, all except bit 27 will remain unchanged. 
Finally, we might want to know how the student at position 27 fared: 
bool status = quiz1 & (1UL << 27); // how did student number 27 do? 
Here we AND a value that has bit 27 turned on with quiz1. The result is nonzero (i.e., true) if bit 27 of quiz1 is also on; otherwise, it evaluates to zero. 
Shift Operators (aka IO Operators) Are Left Associative 

Although many programmers never use the bitwise operators directly, most programmers do use overloaded versions of these operators for IO. An overloaded operator has the same precedence and associativity as the built-in version of that operator. Therefore, programmers need to understand the precedence and associativity of the shift operators even if they never use them with their built-in meaning. 
Because the shift operators are left associative, the expression 
cout << "hi" << " there" << endl; 
executes as 
( (cout << "hi") << " there" ) << endl; 
In this statement, the operand "hi" is grouped with the first << symbol. Its result is grouped with the second, and then that result is grouped with the third. 
The shift operators have midlevel precedence: lower than the arithmetic operators but higher than the relational, assignment, and conditional operators. These relative precedence levels mean we usually have to use parentheses to force the correct grouping of operators with lower precedence. 
cout << 42 +10; // ok: + has higher precedence, so the sum is printed cout << (10 < 42); // ok: parentheses force intended grouping; prints 1 cout << 10 <42; // error: attempt to compare cout to 42! 
The last cout is interpreted as 
(cout << 10) < 42; 
which says to 'write 10 onto cout and then compare the result of that operation (i.e., cout) to 42.¬ß 
Exercises Section 4.8 Exercise 4.25: What is the value of ~'q' << 6 on a machine with 32-bit ints and 8 bit chars, that uses

unsigned long ul1 = 3, ul2 = 7; (a) ul1 & ul2 (b) ul1 | ul2 (c) ul1 && ul2 (d) ul1 || ul2 
4.9. The sizeof Operator 
The sizeof 
operator returns the size, in bytes, of an expression or a type name. The operator is right associative. The result of sizeof is a constant expression (¬ß 2.4.4, p. 65) of type size_t (¬ß 3.5.2, p. 116). The operator takes one of two forms: 
sizeof (type) 
sizeof expr 
In the second form, sizeof returns the size of the type returned by the given expression. The sizeof operator is unusual in that it does not evaluate its operand: 
Sales_data data, *p; 
sizeof(Sales_data); // size required to hold an object of type 
Sales_data 
sizeof data; // size of data's type, i.e., sizeof(Sales_data) 
sizeof p; // size of a pointer 
sizeof *p; // size of the type to which p points, i.e., sizeof(Sales_data) 
sizeof data.revenue; // size of the type of Sales_data's revenue 
member 
sizeof Sales_data::revenue; // alternative way to get the size of 
revenue 
The most interesting of these examples is sizeof *p. First, because sizeof is right associative and has the same precedence as *, this expression groups right to left. That is, it is equivalent to sizeof (*p). Second, because sizeof does not evaluate its operand, it doesn't matter that p is an invalid (i.e., uninitialized) pointer (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 52). Dereferencing an invalid pointer as the operand to sizeof is safe because the pointer is not actually used. sizeof doesn't need dereference the pointer to know what type it will return. 
Under the new standard, we can use the scope operator to ask for the size of a member of a class type. Ordinarily we can only access the members of a class through an object of that type. We don't need to supply an object, because sizeof does not need to fetch the member to know its size. 

The result of applying sizeof depends in part on the type involved: 
. 
sizeof char or an expression of type char is guaranteed to be 1. 

. 
sizeof a reference type returns the size of an object of the referenced type. 

. 
sizeof a pointer returns the size needed hold a pointer. 

. 
sizeof a dereferenced pointer returns the size of an object of the type to which the pointer points; the pointer need not be valid. 

. 
sizeof an array is the size of the entire array. It is equivalent to taking the sizeof the element type times the number of elements in the array. Note that sizeof does not convert the array to a pointer. 

. 
sizeof a string or a vector returns only the size of the fixed part of these types; it does not return the size used by the object's elements. 


Because sizeof returns the size of the entire array, we can determine the number of elements in an array by dividing the array size by the element size: 
// sizeof(ia)/sizeof(*ia) returns the number of elements in ia constexpr size_t sz = sizeof(ia)/sizeof(*ia); int arr2[sz]; // ok sizeof returns a constant expression ¬ß 2.4.4 (p. 65) 
Because sizeof returns a constant expression, we can use the result of a sizeof expression to specify the dimension of an array. 
4.10. Comma Operator 
The comma operator takes two operands, which it evaluates from left to right. Like the logical AND and logical OR and the conditional operator, the comma operator guarantees the order in which its operands are evaluated. 
Exercises Section 4.9 
Exercise 4.28: Write a program to print the size of each of the built-in types. Exercise 4.29: Predict the output of the following code and 
explain your reasoning. Now run the program. Is the output what you expected? If not, figure out why. 
int x[10]; int *p = x; cout << sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x) << endl; cout << sizeof(p)/sizeof(*p) << endl; 
Exercise 4.30: Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to match the default evaluation: 
(a) 
sizeof x + y 

(b) 
sizeof p->mem[i] 

(c) 
sizeof a < b 

(d) 
sizeof f() 

The left-hand expression is evaluated and its result is discarded. The result of a comma expression is the value of its right-hand expression. The result is an lvalue if the right-hand operand is an lvalue. 
One common use for the comma operator is in a for loop: 
vector<int>::size_type cnt = ivec.size(); 
// assign values from size... 1 to the elements in ivec 
for(vector<int>::size_type ix = 0; ix != ivec.size(); ++ix, --cnt) 
ivec[ix] = cnt; This loop increments ix and decrements cnt in the expression in the for header. Both ix and cnt are changed on each trip through the loop. As long as the test of ix succeeds, we reset the next element to the current value of cnt.

Exercise 4.31: The program in this section used the prefix increment and decrement operators. Explain why we used prefix and not postfix. What changes would have to be made to use the postfix versions? Rewrite the program using postfix operators. 
Exercise 4.32: Explain the following loop. 
constexpr int size = 5; int ia[size] = {1,2,3,4,5}; for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0; 
ix != size && ptr != ia+size; 
++ix, ++ptr) { /* ... */ } 
Exercise 4.33: Using Table 4.12 (p. 166) explain what the following expression does: 
someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y 

### 4.11. Type Conversions 

üìñIn C++ some types are related to each other. When two types are related, we can use an object or value of one type where an operand of the related type is expected. Two types are related if there is a **conversion** between them.

As an example, consider the following expression, which initializes `ival` to 6:

```c++
int ival = 3.541 + 3; // the compiler might warn about loss of precision
```

The operands of the addition are values of two different types: `3.541` has type `double`, and `3` is an `int`. Rather than attempt to add values of the two different types, C++ defines a set of conversions to transform the operands to a common type. These conversions are carried out automatically without programmer intervention‚Äî and sometimes without programmer knowledge. For that reason, they are referred to as implicit conversions.

The implicit conversions among the arithmetic types are defined to preserve precision, if possible. Most often, if an expression has both integral and floatingpoint operands, the integer is converted to floating-point. In this case, 3 is converted to double, floating-point addition is done, and the result is a double. 

The initialization happens next. In an initialization, the type of the object we are initializing dominates. The initializer is converted to the object's type. In this case, the double result of the addition is converted to int and used to initialize ival. Converting a double to an int truncates the double's value, discarding the decimal portion. In this expression, the value 6 is assigned to ival. 

##### When Implicit Conversions Occur 

The compiler automatically converts operands in the following circumstances: 

* In most expressions, values of integral types smaller than int are first promoted to an appropriate larger integral type. 
* In conditions, nonbool expressions are converted to bool. 
* In initializations, the initializer is converted to the type of the variable; in assignments, the right-hand operand is converted to the type of the left-hand. 
* In arithmetic and relational expressions with operands of mixed types, the types are converted to a common type. 
* As we'll see in Chapter 6, conversions also happen during function calls. 

#### 4.11.1. The Arithmetic Conversions 

The **arithmetic conversions**, which we introduced in ¬ß 2.1.2 

(p. 35), convert one arithmetic type to another. The rules define a hierarchy of type conversions in which operands to an operator are converted to the widest type. For example, if one operand is of type long double, then the other operand is converted to type long double regardless of what the second type is. More generally, in expressions that mix floating-point and integral values, the integral value is converted to an appropriate floating-point type. 

Integral Promotions 
The integral 
promotions 
convert the small integral types to a larger integral type. The types bool, char, signed char, unsigned char, short, and unsigned short are promoted to int if all possible values of that type fit in an int. Otherwise, the value is promoted to unsigned int. As we've seen many times, a bool that is false promotes to 0 and true to 1. 
The larger char types (wchar_t, char16_t, and char32_t) are promoted to the smallest type of int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, or unsigned long long in which all possible values of that character type fit. 

Operands of Unsigned Type 
If the operands of an operator have differing types, those operands are ordinarily converted to a common type. If any operand is an unsigned type, the type to which the operands are converted depends on the relative sizes of the integral types on the machine. 
As usual, integral promotions happen first. If the resulting type(s) match, no further conversion is needed. If both (possibly promoted) operands have the same signedness, then the operand with the smaller type is converted to the larger type. 
When the signedness differs and the type of the unsigned operand is the same as or larger than that of the signed operand, the signed operand is converted to unsigned. For example, given an unsigned int and an int, the int is converted to unsigned int. It is worth noting that if the int has a negative value, the result will be converted as described in ¬ß 2.1.2 
(p. 35), with the same results. 
The remaining case is when the signed operand has a larger type than the unsigned operand. In this case, the result is machine dependent. If all values in the unsigned type fit in the larger type, then the unsigned operand is converted to the signed type. If the values don't fit, then the signed operand is converted to the unsigned type. For example, if the operands are long and unsigned int, and int and long have the same size, the long will be converted to unsigned int. If the long type has more bits, then the unsigned int will be converted to long. 

Understanding the Arithmetic Conversions 
One way to understand the arithmetic conversions is to study lots of examples: 
bool  flag;  char  cval;  
short  sval;  unsigned  short  usval;  
int  ival;  unsigned  int  uival;  
long  lval;  unsigned long  ulval;  
float  fval;  double  dval;  

3.14159L + 'a'; // 'a' promoted to int, then that int converted to long double dval + ival; // ival converted to double dval + fval; // fval converted to double ival = dval; // dval converted (by truncation) to int flag = dval; // if dval is 0, then flag is false, otherwise true cval + fval; // cval promoted to int, then that int converted to float sval + cval; // sval and cval promoted to int cval + lval; // cval converted to long ival + ulval; // ival converted to unsigned long usval + ival; // promotion depends on the size of unsigned short and int uival + lval; // conversion depends on the size of unsigned int and long 
In the first addition, the character constant lowercase 'a' has type char, which is a numeric value (¬ß 2.1.1, p. 32). What that value is depends on the machine's character set. On our machine, 'a' has the numeric value 97. When we add 'a' to a long double, the char value is promoted to int, and then that int value is converted to a long double. The converted value is added to the literal. The other interesting cases are the last two expressions involving unsigned values. The type of the result in these expressions is machine dependent. 
Exercises Section 4.11.1 Exercise 4.34: Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions: 
(a) 
if (fval) 

(b) 
dval = fval + ival; 

(c) 
dval + ival * cval; 


Remember that you may need to consider the associativity of the operators. 
Exercise 4.35: Given the following definitions, 
char cval; int ival; unsigned int ui; float fval; double dval; 
identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place: 
(a) 
cval = 'a' +3; 

(b) 
fval = ui -ival * 1.0; 

(c) 
dval = ui * fval; 

(d) 
cval = ival + fval + dval; 


4.11.2. Other Implicit Conversions 

In addition to the arithmetic conversions, there are several 
additional kinds of implicit conversions. These include: Array to Pointer Conversions: In most expressions, when we use an array, the array is automatically converted to a pointer to the first element in that array: 
int ia[10]; // array of ten ints int* ip = ia; // convert ia to a pointer to the first element 
This conversion is not performed when an array is used with decltype or as the operand of the address-of (&), sizeof, or typeid (which we'll cover in ¬ß 19.2.2 
(p. 826)) operators. The conversion is also omitted when we initialize a reference to an array (¬ß 3.5.1, p. 114). As we'll see in ¬ß 6.7 
(p. 247), a similar pointer conversion happens when we use a function type in an expression. 
Pointer Conversions: There are several other pointer conversions: A constant integral value of 0 and the literal nullptr can be converted to any pointer type; a pointer to any nonconst type can be converted to void*, and a pointer to any type can be converted to a const void*. We'll see in ¬ß 15.2.2 
(p. 
597) that there is an additional pointer conversion that applies 
to types related by inheritance. Conversions to bool: There is an automatic conversion from arithmetic or pointer types to bool. If the pointer or arithmetic value is zero, the conversion yields false; any other value yields true: 
char *cp = get_string(); 
if (cp) /* ... */ // true if the pointer cp is not zero 
while (*cp) /* ... */ // true if *cp is not the null character 
Conversion to const: We can convert a pointer to a nonconst type to a pointer to the corresponding const type, and similarly for references. That is, if T is a type, we can convert a pointer or a reference to T into a pointer or reference to const T, respectively (¬ß 2.4.1, p. 61, and ¬ß 2.4.2, p. 62): 
int i; const int &j = i; // convert a nonconst to a reference to const int const int *p = &i; // convert address of a nonconst to the address of a const int &r = j, *q = p; // error: conversion from const to nonconst not allowed 
The reverse conversion'removing a low-level const'does not exist. 
Conversions Defined by Class Types: Class types can define conversions that the compiler will apply automatically. The compiler will apply only one class-type conversion at a time. In ¬ß 7.5.4 
(p. 295) we'll see an example of when multiple conversions might be required, and will be rejected. 
Our programs have already used class-type conversions: We use a class-type conversion when we use a C-style character string where a library string is expected (¬ß 3.5.5, p. 124) and when we read from an istream in a condition: 
string s, t = "a value"; // character string literal converted to type string while (cin >> s) // while condition converts cin to bool 
The condition (cin >> s) reads cin and yields cin as its result. Conditions expect a value of type bool, but this condition tests a value of type istream. The IO library defines a conversion from istream to bool. That conversion is used (automatically) to convert cin to bool. The resulting bool value depends on the state of the stream. If the last read succeeded, then the conversion yields true. If the last attempt failed, then the conversion to bool yields false. 
4.11.3. Explicit Conversions 
Sometimes we want to explicitly force an object to be converted to a different type. For example, we might want to use floating-point division in the following code: 
int i, j; 
double slope = i/j; 
To do so, we'd need a way to explicitly convert i and/or j to double. We use a cast 
to request an explicit conversion. 

Warning 
Although necessary at times, casts are inherently dangerous constructs. 


Named Casts 
A named cast has the following form: 
cast-name<type>(expression); 
where type is the target type of the conversion, and expression is the value to be cast. If type is a reference, then the result is an lvalue. The cast-name may be one of static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast. We'll cover dynamic_cast, which supports the run-time type identification, in ¬ß 19.2 
(p. 825). The cast-name determines what kind of conversion is performed. 
static_cast 
Any well-defined type conversion, other than those involving low-level const, can be requested using a static_cast. For example, we can force our expression to use floating-point division by casting one of the operands to double: 
// cast used to force floating-point division 
double slope = static_cast<double>(j) / i; 
A static_cast is often useful when a larger arithmetic type is assigned to a smaller type. The cast informs both the reader of the program and the compiler that we are aware of and are not concerned about the potential loss of precision. Compilers often generate a warning for assignments of a larger arithmetic type to a smaller type. When we do an explicit cast, the warning message is turned off. 
A static_cast is also useful to perform a conversion that the compiler will not generate automatically. For example, we can use a static_cast to retrieve a pointer value that was stored in a void* pointer (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 56): 
void* p = &d; // ok: address of any nonconst object can be stored in a void* // ok: converts void* back to the original pointer type double *dp = static_cast<double*>(p); 
When we store a pointer in a void* and then use a static_cast to cast the pointer back to its original type, we are guaranteed that the pointer value is preserved. That is, the result of the cast will be equal to the original address value. However, we must be certain that the type to which we cast the pointer is the actual type of that pointer; if the types do not match, the result is undefined. 

const_cast 
A const_cast changes only a low-level (¬ß 2.4.3, p. 63) const in its operand: 
const char *pc; char *p = const_cast<char*>(pc); // ok: but writing through p is undefined 
Conventionally we say that a cast that converts a const object to a nonconst type 'casts away the const.¬ß Once we have cast away the const of an object, the compiler will no longer prevent us from writing to that object. If the object was originally not a const, using a cast to obtain write access is legal. However, using a const_cast in order to write to a const object is undefined. 
Only a const_cast may be used to change the constness of an expression. Trying to change whether an expression is const with any of the other forms of named cast is a compile-time error. Similarly, we cannot use a const_cast to change the type of an expression: 
const char *cp; // error: static_cast can't cast away const 
char *q = static_cast<char*>(cp); static_cast<string>(cp); // ok: converts string literal to string const_cast<string>(cp); // error: const_cast only changes constness 
A const_cast is most useful in the context of overloaded functions, which we'll describe in ¬ß 6.4 
(p. 232). 

reinterpret_cast 
A reinterpret_cast generally performs a low-level reinterpretation of the bit pattern of its operands. As an example, given the following cast 
int *ip; 
char *pc = reinterpret_cast<char*>(ip); 
we must never forget that the actual object addressed by pc is an int, not a character. Any use of pc that assumes it's an ordinary character pointer is likely to fail at run time. For example: 
string str(pc); 
is likely to result in bizarre run-time behavior. 
The use of pc to initialize str is a good example of why reinterpret_cast is dangerous. The problem is that types are changed, yet there are no warnings or errors from the compiler. When we initialized pc with the address of an int, there is no error or warning from the compiler because we explicitly said the conversion was okay. Any subsequent use of pc will assume that the value it holds is a char*. The compiler has no way of knowing that it actually holds a pointer to an int. Thus, the initialization of str with pc is absolutely correct'albeit in this case meaningless or worse! Tracking down the cause of this sort of problem can prove extremely difficult, especially if the cast of ip to pc occurs in a file separate from the one in which pc is used to initialize a string. 


Warning 
A reinterpret_cast is inherently machine dependent. Safely using reinterpret_cast requires completely understanding the types involved as well as the details of how the compiler implements the cast. 
Old-Style Casts 
In early versions of C++, an explicit cast took one of the following two forms: 
type (expr); // function-style cast notation (type) expr; // C-language-style cast notation 
Advice: Avoid Casts Casts interfere with normal type checking (¬ß 2.2.2, p. 46). As a result, we strongly recommend that programmers avoid casts. This advice is particularly applicable to reinterpret_casts. Such casts are always hazardous. A const_cast can be useful in the context of overloaded functions, which we'll cover in ¬ß 6.4 
(p. 232). Other uses of const_cast often indicate a design flaw. The other casts, static_cast and dynamic_cast, should be needed infrequently. Every time you write a cast, you should think hard about whether you can achieve the same result in a different way. If the cast is unavoidable, errors can be mitigated by limiting the scope in which the cast value is used and by documenting all assumptions about the types involved. 
Depending on the types involved, an old-style cast has the same behavior as a const_cast,a static_cast, or a reinterpret_cast. When we use an old-style cast where a static_cast or a const_cast would be legal, the old-style cast does the same conversion as the respective named cast. If neither cast is legal, then an old-style cast performs a reinterpret_cast. For example: 
char *pc = (char*) ip; // ip is a pointer to int has the same effect as using a reinterpret_cast. 

Warning 
Old-style casts are less visible than are named casts. Because they are easily overlooked, it is more difficult to track down a rogue cast. 
Exercises Section 4.11.3 Exercise 4.36: Assuming i is an int and d is a double 
write the expression i *= d so that it does integral, rather than floating-point, multiplication. Exercise 4.37: Rewrite each of the following old-style 
casts to use a named cast: 
int i; double d; const string *ps; char *pc; void *pv; 
(a) 
pv = (void*)ps; 

(b) 
i = int(*pc); 

(c) 
pv = &d; 


(d) pc = (char*) pv; Exercise 4.38: Explain the following expression: 
double slope = static_cast<double>(j/i); 
4.12. Operator Precedence Table Table 4.4. Operator Precedence 


Chapter Summary 
C++ provides a rich set of operators and defines their meaning when applied to values of the built-in types. Additionally, the language supports operator overloading, which allows us to define the meaning of the operators for class types. We'll see in Chapter 
14 
how to define operators for our own types. 
To understand expressions involving more than one operator it is necessary to understand precedence, associativity, and order of operand evaluation. Each operator has a precedence level and associativity. Precedence determines how operators are grouped in a compound expression. Associativity determines how operators at the same precedence level are grouped. 
Most operators do not specify the order in which operands are evaluated: The compiler is free to evaluate either the left-or right-hand operand first. Often, the order of operand evaluation has no impact on the result of the expression. However, if both operands refer to the same object and one of the operands changes that object, then the program has a serious bug'and a bug that may be hard to find. 
Finally, operands are often converted automatically from their initial type to another related type. For example, small integral types are promoted to a larger integral type in every expression. Conversions exist for both built-in and class types. Conversions can also be done explicitly through a cast. 
Defined Terms 
arithmetic 
conversion 
A conversion from one arithmetic type to another. In the context of the binary arithmetic operators, arithmetic conversions usually attempt to preserve precision by converting a smaller type to a larger type (e.g., integral types are converted to floating point). 
associativity 
Determines how operators with the same precedence are grouped. Operators can be either right associative (operators are grouped from right to left) or left associative (operators are grouped from left to right). 
binary 
operators 
Operators that take two operands. 
cast 
An explicit conversion. 
compound 
expression 
An expression involving more than one operator. 
const_cast 
A cast that converts a low-level const object to the corresponding nonconst type or vice versa. 
conversion 
Process whereby a value of one type is transformed into a value of another type. The language defines conversions among the built-in types. Conversions to and from class types are also possible. 
dynamic_cast 
Used in combination with inheritance and run-time type identification. See ¬ß 19.2 
(p. 825). 
expression 
The lowest level of computation in a C++ program. Expressions generally apply an operator to one or more operands. Each expression yields a result. Expressions can be used as operands, so we can write compound expressions requiring the evaluation of multiple operators. 
implicit 
conversion 
A conversion that is automatically generated by the compiler. Given an expression that needs a particular type but has an operand of a differing type, the compiler will automatically convert the operand to the desired type if an appropriate conversion exists. 
integral 
promotions 
conversions that take a smaller integral type to its most closely related larger integral type. Operands of small integral types (e.g., short, char, etc.) are always promoted, even in contexts where such conversions might not seem to be required. 
lvalue 
An expression that yields an object or function. A nonconst lvalue that denotes an object may be the left-hand operand of assignment. 
operands 
Values on which an expression operates. Each operator has one or more operands associated with it. 
operator 
Symbol that determines what action an expression performs. The language defines a set of operators and what those operators mean when applied to values of built-in type. The language also defines the precedence and associativity of each operator and specifies how many operands each operator takes. Operators may be overloaded and applied to values of class type. 
order 
of 
evaluation 
Order, if any, in which the operands to an operator are evaluated. In most cases, the compiler is free to evaluate operands in any order. However, the operands are always evaluated before the operator itself is evaluated. Only the &&, ||, ?:, and comma operators specify the order in which their operands are evaluated. 
overloaded 
operator 
Version of an operator that is defined for use with a class type. We'll see in Chapter 
14 
how to define overloaded versions of operators. 
precedence 
Defines the order in which different operators in a compound expression are grouped. Operators with higher precedence are grouped more tightly than operators with lower precedence. 
promoted 
See integral promotions. 
reinterpret_cast 
Interprets the contents of the operand as a different type. Inherently machine dependent and dangerous. 
result 
Value or object obtained by evaluating an expression. 
rvalue 
Expression that yields a value but not the associated location, if any, of that value. 
short-circuit 
evaluation 
Term used to describe how the logical AND and logical OR operators execute. If the first operand to these operators is sufficient to determine the overall result, evaluation stops. We are guaranteed that the second operand is not evaluated. 
sizeof 
Operator that returns the size, in bytes, to store an object of a given type name or of the type of a given expression. 
static_cast 
An explicit request for a well-defined type conversion. Often used to override an implicit conversion that the compiler would otherwise perform. 
unary 
operators 
Operators that take a single operand. 
, operator Comma operator. Binary operator that is evaluated left to right. The result of a comma expression is the value of the right-hand operand. The result is an lvalue if and only if that operand is an lvalue. 
?: 
operator 
Conditional operator. Provides an if-then-else expression of the form 
cond ? expr1 : expr2; 
If the condition cond is true, then expr1 is evaluated. 
Otherwise, expr2 is evaluated. The type expr1 and expr2 must be the same type or be convertible to a common type. Only one of expr1 or expr2 is evaluated. 
&& operator Logical AND operator. Result is true if both operands are true. The right-hand operand is evaluated only if the left-hand operand is true. 
& 
operator 
Bitwise AND operator. Generates a new integral value in which each bit position is 1 if both operands have a 1 in that position; otherwise the bit is 0. 
^ 
operator 
Bitwise exclusive or operator. Generates a new integral value in which each bit position is 1 if either but not both operands contain a 1 in that bit position; otherwise, the bit is 0. 
|| operator Logical OR operator. Yields true if either operand is true. The right-hand operand is evaluated only if the left-hand operand is false. 
| operator 
Bitwise OR operator. Generates a new integral value in which each bit position is 1 if either operand has a 1 in that position; otherwise the bit is 0. 
++ operator The increment operator. The increment operator has two forms, prefix and postfix. Prefix increment yields an lvalue. It adds 1 to the operand and returns the changed value of the operand. Postfix increment yields an rvalue. It adds 1 to the operand and returns a copy of the original, unchanged value of the operand. Note: Iterators have ++ even if they do not have the + operator. 
--operator The decrement operator has two forms, prefix and postfix. Prefix decrement yields an lvalue. It subtracts 1 from the operand and returns the changed value of the operand. Postfix decrement yields an rvalue. It subtracts 1 from the operand and returns a copy of the original, unchanged value of the operand. Note: Iterators have -.even if they do not have the -. 
<< 
operator 
The left-shift operator. Shifts bits in a (possibly promoted) copy of the value of the left-hand operand to the left. Shifts as many bits as indicated by the right-hand operand. The right-hand operand must be zero or positive and strictly less than the number of bits in the result. Left-hand operand should be unsigned; if the left-hand operand is signed, it is undefined if a shift causes a different bit to shift into the sign bit. 
>> 
operator 
The right-shift operator. Like the left-shift operator except that bits are shifted to the right. If the left-hand operand is signed, it is implementation defined whether bits shifted into the result are 0 or a copy of the sign bit. 
~ 
operator 
Bitwise NOT operator. Generates a new integral value in which each bit is an inverted copy of the corresponding bit in the (possibly promoted) operand. 
! operator Logical NOT operator. Returns the inverse of the bool value of its operand. Result is true if operand is false and vice versa.

Summary 

Defined 
Terms 
Like most languages, C++ provides statements for conditional execution, loops that repeatedly execute the same body of code, and jump statements that interrupt the flow of control. This chapter looks in detail at the statements supported by C++. 
Statements are executed sequentially. Except for the simplest programs, sequential execution is inadequate. Therefore, C++ also defines a set of flow-of-control 
statements that allow more complicated execution paths. 
5.1. Simple Statements 

Most statements in C++ end with a semicolon. An expression, such as ival + 5, becomes an expression 
statement 
when it is followed by a semicolon. Expression statements cause the expression to be evaluated and its result discarded: 
ival +5; // rather useless expression statement 
cout << ival; // useful expression statement 
The first statement is pretty useless: The addition is done but the result is not used. More commonly, an expression statement contains an expression that has a side effect'such as assigning a new value to a variable, or printing a result'when it is evaluated. 
Null Statements 
The simplest statement is the empty statement, also known as a null 
statement. A null statement is a single semicolon: 
; // null statement 
A null statement is useful where the language requires a statement but the program's logic does not. Such usage is most common when a loop's work can be done within its condition. For example, we might want to read an input stream, ignoring everything we read until we encounter a particular value: 
// read until we hit end-of-file or find an input equal to sought 
while (cin >> s && s != sought) ; // null statement 
This condition reads a value from the standard input and implicitly tests cin to see whether the read was successful. Assuming the read succeeded, the second part of the condition tests whether the value we read is equal to the value in sought. 
If we found the value we want, the while loop is exited. Otherwise, the condition is evaluated again, which reads another value from cin. 

Best Practices 
Null statements should be commented. That way anyone reading the code can see that the statement was omitted intentionally. 
Beware of Missing or Extraneous Semicolons 
Because a null statement is a statement, it is legal anywhere a statement is expected. For this reason, semicolons that might appear illegal are often nothing more than null statements. The following fragment contains two statements'the expression statement and the null statement: 
ival = v1 + v2;; // ok: second semicolon is a superfluous null statement 
Although an unnecessary null statement is often harmless, an extra semicolon following the condition in a while or if can drastically alter the programmer's intent. For example, the following code will loop indefinitely: 
// disaster: extra semicolon: loop body is this null statement 
while (iter != svec.end()) ; // the while body is the empty 
statement 
++iter; // increment is not part of the loop 
Contrary to the indentation, the increment is not part of the loop. The loop body is the null statement formed by the semicolon that follows the condition. 

Warning 
Extraneous null statements are not always harmless. 
Compound Statements (Blocks) 
A compound 
statement, usually referred to as a block,is a (possibly empty) sequence of statements and declarations surrounded by a pair of curly braces. A block is a scope (¬ß 2.2.4, p. 48). Names introduced inside a block are accessible only in that block and in blocks nested inside that block. Names are visible from where they are defined until the end of the (immediately) enclosing block. 
Compound statements are used when the language requires a single statement but the logic of our program needs more than one. For example, the body of a while or for loop must be a single statement, yet we often need to execute more than one statement in the body of a loop. We do so by enclosing the statements in curly braces, thus turning the sequence of statements into a block. 
As one example, recall the while loop in the program in ¬ß 1.4.1 
(p. 11): 
while (val <= 10) { sum += val; // assigns sum + val to sum ++val; // add 1 to val 
} The logic of our program needed two statements but a while loop may contain only one statement. By enclosing these statements in curly braces, we made them into a single (compound) statement. 

Note 
A block is not terminated by a semicolon. 
We also can define an empty block by writing a pair of curlies with no statements. An empty block is equivalent to a null statement: 
while (cin >> s && s != sought) {} // empty block 
Exercises Section 5.1 
Exercise 5.1: What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement? Exercise 5.2: What is a block? When might you might use 
a block? Exercise 5.3: Use the comma operator (¬ß 4.10, p. 157) to rewrite the while loop from ¬ß 1.4.1 
(p. 11) so that it no longer requires a block. Explain whether this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this code. 
5.2. Statement Scope 
We can define variables inside the control structure of the if, switch, while, and for statements. Variables defined in the control structure are visible only within that statement and are out of scope after the statement ends: 
while (int i = get_num()) // i is created and initialized on each iteration cout << i << endl; i=0; // error: i is not accessible outside the loop 
If we need access to the control variable, then that variable must be defined outside the statement: 
// find the first negative element 
auto beg = v.begin(); 
while (beg != v.end() && *beg >= 0) 
++beg; if (beg == v.end()) // we know that all elements in v are greater than or equal to zero 
The value of an object defined in a control structure is used by that structure. Therefore, such variables must be initialized. 
Exercises Section 5.2 Exercise 5.4: Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems you detect. 
(a) 
while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* ... */ } 

(b) 
while (bool status = find(word)) { /* ... */ } if (!status) { /* ... */ } 


5.3. Conditional Statements 
C++ provides two statements that allow for conditional execution. The if statement determines the flow of control based on a condition. The switch statement evaluates an integral expression and chooses one of several execution paths based on the expression's value. 
5.3.1. The if Statement 

An if 
statement 
conditionally executes another statement based on whether a specified condition is true. There are two forms of the if: one with an else branch and one without. The syntactic form of the simple if is 
if (condition) statement 
An if 
else 
statement 
has the form 
if (condition) statement 
else 
statement2 
In both versions, condition must be enclosed in parentheses. condition can be an expression or an initialized variable declaration (¬ß 5.2, p. 174). The expression or variable must have a type that is convertible (¬ß 4.11, p. 159) to bool. As usual, either or both statement and statement2 can be a block. 
If condition is true, then statement is executed. After statement completes, execution continues with the statement following the if. 
If condition is false, statement is skipped. In a simple if, execution continues with the statement following the if. In an if else, statement2 is executed. 
Using an if else Statement 
To illustrate an if statement, we'll calculate a letter grade from a numeric grade. We'll assume that the numeric grades range from zero to 100 inclusive. A grade of 100 gets an 'A++,¬ß grades below 60 get an 'F,¬ß and the others range in clumps of ten: grades from 60 to 69 inclusive get a 'D,¬ß 70 to 79 a 'C,¬ß and so on. We'll use a vector to hold the possible letter grades: 
vector<string> scores = {"F", "D", "C", "B", "A", "A++"}; 
To solve this problem, we can use an if else statement to execute different actions for failing and passing grades: 
// if grade is less than 60 it's an F, otherwise compute a subscript 
string lettergrade; 
if (grade < 60) 
lettergrade = scores[0]; 
else 
lettergrade = scores[(grade -50)/10]; Depending on the value of grade, we execute the statement after the if or the one after the else. In the else, we compute a subscript from a grade by reducing the grade to account for the larger range of failing grades. Then we use integer division (¬ß 4.2, p. 141), which truncates the remainder, to calculate the appropriate scores index. 
Nested if Statements 
To make our program more interesting, we'll add a plus or minus to passing grades. We'll give a plus to grades ending in 8 or 9, and a minus to those ending in 0, 1, or 2: 
if (grade % 10 >7) lettergrade += '+'; // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a 
+ 
else if (grade % 10 < 3) lettergrade += '-'; // those ending in 0, 1, or 2 geta .
Here we use the modulus operator (¬ß 4.2, p. 141) to get the remainder and decide based on the remainder whether to add plus or minus. 
We next will incorporate the code that adds a plus or minus to the code that fetches the letter grade from scores: 
// if failing grade, no need to check for a plus or minus if (grade < 60) lettergrade = scores[0]; else { lettergrade = scores[(grade -50)/10]; // fetch the letter grade if (grade != 100) // add plus or minus only if not already an A++ 
if (grade % 10 > 7) lettergrade += '+'; // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a + else if (grade % 10 < 3) lettergrade += '-'; // grades ending in 0, 1, or 2 geta .} 
Note that we use a block to enclose the two statements that follow the first else. If the grade is 60 or more, we have two actions that we need to do: Fetch the letter grade from scores, and conditionally set the plus or minus. 
Watch Your Braces 
It is a common mistake to forget the curly braces when multiple statements must be executed as a block. In the following example, contrary to the indentation, the code to add a plus or minus happens unconditionally: 
if (grade < 60) lettergrade = scores[0]; else // WRONG: missing curly lettergrade = scores[(grade -50)/10]; 
// despite appearances, without the curly brace, this code is always executed // failing grades will incorrectly get a -or a + 
if (grade != 100) if (grade % 10 > 7) lettergrade += '+'; // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a + else if (grade % 10 < 3) lettergrade += '-'; // grades ending in 0, 1, or 2 geta .
Uncovering this error may be very difficult because the program looks correct. 
To avoid such problems, some coding styles recommend always using braces after an if or an else (and also around the bodies of while and for statements). 
Doing so avoids any possible confusion. It also means that the braces are already in place if later modifications of the code require adding statements. 

Best Practices 
Many editors and development environments have tools to automatically indent source code to match its structure. It is a good idea to use such tools if they are available. 
Dangling else 
When we nest an if inside another if, it is possible that there will be more if branches than else branches. Indeed, our grading program has four ifs and two elses. The question arises: How do we know to which if a given else belongs? 
This problem, usually referred to as a dangling 
else, is common to many programming languages that have both if and if else statements. Different languages solve this problem in different ways. In C++ the ambiguity is resolved by specifying that each else is matched with the closest preceding unmatched if. 
Programmers sometimes get into trouble when they write code that contains more if than else branches. To illustrate the problem, we'll rewrite the innermost if else that adds a plus or minus using a different set of conditions: 
// WRONG: execution does NOT match indentation; the else goes with the inner if 
if (grade % 10 >= 3) if (grade % 10 > 7) lettergrade += '+'; // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a + else lettergrade += '-'; // grades ending in 3, 4, 5, 6 will get a minus! 
The indentation in our code indicates that we intend the else to go with the outer if'we intend for the else branch to be executed when the grade ends in a digit less than 3. However, despite our intentions, and contrary to the indentation, the else branch is part of the inner if. This code adds a '-' to grades ending in 3 to 7 inclusive! Properly indented to match the actual execution, what we wrote is: 
// indentation matches the execution path, not the programmer's intent 
if (grade % 10 >= 3) 
if (grade %10 > 7) 
lettergrade += '+'; // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a + 
else 
lettergrade += '-'; // grades ending in 3, 4, 5, 6 will get a 
minus! 
Controlling the Execution Path with Braces 
We can make the else part of the outer if by enclosing the inner if in a block: 
// add a plus for grades that end in 8 or 9 and a minus for those ending 
in 0, 1,or 2 
if (grade % 10 >= 3) { if (grade % 10 > 7) lettergrade += '+'; // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a + } else // curlies force the else to go with the outer if lettergrade += '-'; // grades ending in 0, 1, or 2 will get a minus 
Statements do not span block boundaries, so the inner if ends at the close curly before the else. The else cannot be part of the inner if. Now, the nearest unmatched if is the outer if, which is what we intended all along. 
Exercises Section 5.3.1 
Exercise 5.5: Using an if.else statement, write your own version of the program to generate the letter grade from a numeric grade. 
Exercise 5.6: Rewrite your grading program to use the conditional operator (¬ß 4.7, p. 151) in place of the if.else statement. 
Exercise 5.7: Correct the errors in each of the following code fragments: 
(a) if (ival1 != ival2) ival1 = ival2 else ival1 = ival2 = 0; 
(b) 
if (ival < minval) minval = ival; occurs = 1; 

(c) 
if (int ival = get_value()) cout << "ival = " << ival << endl; 

if (!ival) cout << "ival = 0\n"; 

(d) 
if (ival = 0) ival = get_value(); 


Exercise 5.8: What is a 'dangling else'? How are else clauses resolved in C++? 
5.3.2. The switch Statement 
A switch 
statement 
provides a convenient way of selecting among a (possibly large) number of fixed alternatives. As one example, suppose that we want to count how often each of the five vowels appears in some segment of text. Our program logic is as follows: 
. 
Read every character in the input. 

. 
Compare each character to the set of vowels. 

. 
If the character matches one of the vowels, add 1 to that vowel's count. 

. 
Display the results. 


For example, when we run the program on the text of this chapter, the output is 
Number of vowel a: 3195 Number of vowel e: 6230 Number of vowel i: 3102 Number of vowel o: 3289 Number of vowel u: 1033 
We can solve our problem most directly using a switch statement: 
// initialize counters for each vowel unsigned aCnt = 0, eCnt = 0, iCnt = 0, oCnt = 0, uCnt = 0; char ch; while (cin >> ch) { 
// if ch is a vowel, increment the appropriate counter 
switch (ch) { 
case 'a': ++aCnt; break; 
case 'e': 
++eCnt; break; 
case 'i': ++iCnt; break; 
case 'o': ++oCnt; break; 
case 'u': ++uCnt; break; 
} } // print results cout << "Number of vowel a: \t" << aCnt << '\n' 
<< "Number of vowel e: \t" << eCnt << '\n' << "Number of vowel i: \t" << iCnt << '\n' << "Number of vowel o: \t" << oCnt << '\n' << "Number of vowel u: \t" << uCnt << endl; 
A switch statement executes by evaluating the parenthesized expression that follows the keyword switch. That expression may be an initialized variable declaration (¬ß 5.2, p. 174). The expression is converted to integral type. The result of the expression is compared with the value associated with each case. 
If the expression matches the value of a case label, execution begins with the first statement following that label. Execution continues normally from that statement through the end of the switch or until a break statement. 
We'll look at break statements in detail in ¬ß 5.5.1 
(p. 190), but, briefly, a break interrupts the current control flow. In this case, the break transfers control out of the switch. In this program, the switch is the only statement in the body of a while. Breaking out of this switch returns control to the enclosing while. Because there are no other statements in that while, execution continues at the condition in the while. 
If no match is found, execution falls through to the first statement following the switch. As we already know, in this example, exiting the switch returns control to the condition in the while. 
The case keyword and its associated value together are known as the case 
label. case labels must be integral constant expressions (¬ß 2.4.4, p. 65): 
char ch = getVal(); 
int ival = 42; 
switch(ch) { 
case 3.14: // error: noninteger as case label case ival: // error: nonconstant as case label // ... 
It is an error for any two case labels to have the same value. There is also a special-case label, default, which we cover on page 181. 
Control Flow within a switch 
It is important to understand that execution flows across case labels. After a case label is matched, execution starts at that label and continues across all the remaining cases or until the program explicitly interrupts it. To avoid executing code for subsequent cases, we must explicitly tell the compiler to stop execution. Under most conditions, the last statement before the next case label is break. 
However, there are situations where the default switch behavior is exactly what is needed. Each case label can have only a single value, but sometimes we have two or more values that share a common set of actions. In such instances, we omit a break statement, allowing the program to fall through multiple case labels. 
For example, we might want to count only the total number of vowels: 
unsigned vowelCnt = 0; // ... switch (ch) { 
// any occurrence of a, e, i, o, or u increments vowelCnt 
case 'a': case 'e': case 'i': case 'o': case 'u': 
++vowelCnt; break; } 
Here we stacked several case labels together with no intervening break. The same code will be executed whenever ch is a vowel. 
Because C++ programs are free-form, case labels need not appear on a new line. We can emphasize that the cases represent a range of values by listing them all on a single line: 
switch (ch) 
{ // alternative legal syntax case 'a': case 'e': case 'i': case 'o': case 'u': 
++vowelCnt; break; } 

Best Practices 
Omitting a break at the end of a case happens rarely. If you do omit a break, include a comment explaining the logic. 
Forgetting a break Is a Common Source of Bugs 
It is a common misconception to think that only the statements associated with the matched case label are executed. For example, here is an incorrect implementation of our vowel-counting switch statement: 
// warning: deliberately incorrect! switch (ch) { case 'a': ++aCnt; // oops: should have a break statement case 'e': ++eCnt; // oops: should have a break statement case 'i': ++iCnt; // oops: should have a break statement case 'o': ++oCnt; // oops: should have a break statement case 'u': ++uCnt; } 
To understand what happens, assume that the value of ch is 'e'. Execution jumps to the code following the case 'e' label, which increments eCnt. Execution continues across the case labels, incrementing iCnt, oCnt, and uCnt as well. 

Best Practices 
Although it is not necessary to include a break after the last label of a switch, the safest course is to provide one. That way, if an additional case is added later, the break is already in place. 
The default Label 
The statements following the default 
label 
are executed when no case label matches the value of the switch expression. For example, we might add a counter to track how many nonvowels we read. We'll increment this counter, which we'll name 
otherCnt, in the default case: 
// if ch is a vowel, increment the appropriate counter 
switch (ch) { 
case 'a': case 'e': case 'i': case 'o': case 'u': ++vowelCnt; break; 
default: ++otherCnt; break; 
} 
} In this version, if ch is not a vowel, execution will start at the default label and we'll increment otherCnt. 

Best Practices 
It can be useful to define a default label even if there is no work for the default case. Defining an empty default section indicates to subsequent readers that the case was considered. 
A label may not stand alone; it must precede a statement or another case label. If a switch ends with a default case that has no work to do, then the default label must be followed by a null statement or an empty block. 
Variable Definitions inside the Body of a switch 
As we've seen, execution in a switch can jump across case labels. When execution jumps to a particular case, any code that occurred inside the switch before that label is ignored. The fact that code is bypassed raises an interesting question: What happens if the code that is skipped includes a variable definition? 
The answer is that it is illegal to jump from a place where a variable with an initializer is out of scope to a place where that variable is in scope: 
case true: 
// this switch statement is illegal because these initializations 
might be bypassed 
string file_name; // error: control bypasses an implicitly 
initialized variable 
int ival = 0; // error: control bypasses an explicitly 
initialized variable 
int jval; // ok: because jval is not initialized 
break; 
case false: 
// ok: jval is in scope but is uninitialized 
jval = next_num(); // ok: assign a value to jval 
if (file_name.empty()) // file_name is in scope but wasn't 
initialized 
// ... 
If this code were legal, then any time control jumped to the false case, it would bypass the initialization of file_name and ival. Those variables would be in scope. Code following false could use those variables. However, these variables would not have been initialized. As a result, the language does not allow us to jump over an initialization if the initialized variable is in scope at the point to which control transfers. 
If we need to define and initialize a variable for a particular case, we can do so by defining the variable inside a block, thereby ensuring that the variable is out of scope at the point of any subsequent label. 
case true: 
{ // ok: declaration statement within a statement block string file_name = get_file_name(); // ... 
} 
break; case false: if (file_name.empty()) // error: file_name is not in scope 
Exercises Section 5.3.2 Exercise 5.9: Write a program using a series of if 
statements to count the number of vowels in text read from cin. Exercise 5.10: There is one problem with our vowel-
counting program as we've implemented it: It doesn't count capital letters as vowels. Write a program that counts both lower-and uppercase letters as the appropriate vowel'that is, your program should count both 'a' and 'A' as part of aCnt, and so forth. 
Exercise 5.11: Modify our vowel-counting program so that it also counts the number of blank spaces, tabs, and newlines read. 
Exercise 5.12: Modify our vowel-counting program so that it counts the number of occurrences of the following two-character sequences: ff, fl, and fi. 
Exercise 5.13: Each of the programs in the highlighted text on page 184 
contains a common programming error. Identify and correct each error. 
5.4. Iterative Statements 
Iterative statements, commonly called loops, provide for repeated execution until a condition is true. The while and for statements test the condition before executing the body. The do while executes the body and then tests its condition. 
5.4.1. The while Statement 

A while 
statement 
repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a condition is true. Its syntactic form is 
while (condition) statement 
In a while, statement (which is often a block) is executed as long as condition evaluates as true. condition may not be empty. If the first evaluation of condition yields false, statement is not executed. 
The condition can be an expression or an initialized variable declaration (¬ß 5.2, p. 174). Ordinarily, the condition itself or the loop body must do something to change the value of the expression. Otherwise, the loop might never terminate. 

Note 
Variables defined in a while condition or while body are created and destroyed on each iteration. 
Using a while Loop 
A while loop is generally used when we want to iterate indefinitely, such as when we read input. A while is also useful when we want access to the value of the loop control variable 
after the loop finishes. For example: 
Code for Exercise 5.13 
(a) unsigned aCnt = 0, eCnt = 0, iouCnt = 0; char ch = next_text(); switch (ch) { 
case 'a': aCnt++; case 'e': eCnt++; default: iouCnt++; 
} 
(b) unsigned index = some_value(); switch (index) { 
case 1: int ix = get_value(); ivec[ ix ] = index; break; 
default: ix = ivec.size()-1; ivec[ ix ] = index; 
} 
(c) unsigned evenCnt = 0, oddCnt = 0; int digit = get_num() % 10; switch (digit) { 
case 1, 3, 5, 7, 9: oddcnt++; break; 
case 2, 4, 6, 8, 10: evencnt++; break; 
} 
(d) unsigned ival=512, jval=1024, kval=4096; unsigned bufsize; unsigned swt = get_bufCnt(); switch(swt) { 
case ival: bufsize = ival * sizeof(int); break;

case kval: bufsize = kval * sizeof(int); break; 
}

auto beg = v.begin(); 
while (beg != v.end() && *beg >= 0) 
++beg; if (beg == v.end()) // we know that all elements in v are greater than or equal to zero 
The first loop reads data from the standard input. We have no idea how many times this loop will execute. The condition fails when cin reads invalid data, encounters some other input failure, or hits end-of-file. The second loop continues until we find a negative value. When the loop terminates, beg is either equal to v.end(), or it denotes an element in v whose value is less than zero. We can use the state of beg outside the while to determine further processing. 
Exercises Section 5.4.1 Exercise 5.14: Write a program to read strings from standard input looking for duplicated words. The program should find places in the input where one word is followed immediately by itself. Keep track of the largest number of times a single repetition occurs and which word is repeated. Print the maximum number of 
duplicates, or else print a message saying that no word was repeated. For example, if the input is 
how now now now brown cow cow the output should indicate that the word now occurred three times. 
5.4.2. Traditional for Statement 

The syntactic form of the for 
statement 
is: 
for (init-statement condition; expression) statement 
The for and the part inside the parentheses is often referred to as the for header. 
init-statement must be a declaration statement, an expression statement, or a null statement. Each of these statements ends with a semicolon, so the syntactic form can also be thought of as 
for (initializer; condition; expression) statement 
In general, init-statement is used to initialize or assign a starting value that is modified over the course of the loop. condition serves as the loop control. As long as condition evaluates as true, statement is executed. If the first evaluation of condition yields false, statement is not executed. expression usually modifies the variable(s) initialized in init-statement and tested in condition. expression is evaluated after each iteration of the loop. As usual, statement can be either a single or a compound statement. 
Execution Flow in a Traditional for Loop 
Given the following for loop from ¬ß 3.2.3 
(p. 94): 
// process characters in s until we run out of characters or we hit a whitespace 
for (decltype(s.size()) index = 0; index != s.size() && !isspace(s[index]); ++index) s[index] = toupper(s[index]); // capitalize the current character 
the order of evaluation is as follows: 
1. 
init-statement is executed once at the start of the loop. In this example, index is defined and initialized to zero. 

2. 
Next, condition is evaluated. If index is not equal to s.size() and the character at s[index] is not whitespace, the for body is executed. Otherwise, the loop terminates. If the condition is false on the first iteration, then the for body is not executed at all. 

3. 
If the condition is true, the for body executes. In this case, the for body makes the character at s[index] uppercase. 

4. 
Finally, expression is evaluated. In this example, index is 


incremented by 1. These four steps represent the first iteration of the for loop. Step 1 is executed only once on entry to the loop. Steps 2, 3, and 4 are repeated until the condition evaluates as false'that is, when we encounter a whitespace character in s, or index is greater than s.size(). 

Note 
It is worth remembering that the visibility of any object defined within the for header is limited to the body of the for loop. Thus, in this example, index is inaccessible after the for completes. 
Multiple Definitions in the for Header 
As in any other declaration, init-statement can define several objects. However, init-statement may be only a single declaration statement. Therefore, all the variables must have the same base type (¬ß 2.3, p. 50). As one example, we might write a loop to duplicate the elements of a vector on the end as follows: 
// remember the size of v and stop when we get to the original last element 
for (decltype(v.size()) i = 0, sz = v.size(); i != sz; ++i) v.push_back(v[i]); 
In this loop we define both the index, i, and the loop control, sz, in init-statement. 
Omitting Parts of the for Header 
A for header can omit any (or all) of init-statement, condition, or expression. 
We can use a null statement for init-statement when an initialization is unnecessary. For example, we might rewrite the loop that looked for the first negative number in a vector so that it uses a for: 
auto beg = v.begin(); for (/* null */; beg != v.end() && *beg >= 0; ++beg) ; // no work to do 
Note that the semicolon is necessary to indicate the absence of init-statement'more precisely, the semicolon represents a null init-statement. In this loop, the for body is also empty because all the work of the loop is done inside the for condition and expression. The condition decides when it's time to stop looking and the expression increments the iterator. 
Omitting condition is equivalent to writing true as the condition. Because the condition always evaluates as true, the for body must contain a statement that exits the loop. Otherwise the loop will execute indefinitely: 
for (int i = 0; /* no condition */ ; ++i) { // process i; code inside the loop must stop the iteration! 
} 
We can also omit expression from the for header. In such loops, either the condition or the body must do something to advance the iteration. As an example, we'll rewrite the while loop that read input into a vector of ints: 
vector<int> v; for (int i; cin >> i; /* no expression */ ) v.push_back(i); 
In this loop there is no need for an expression because the condition changes the value of i. The condition tests the input stream so that the loop ends when we've read all the input or encounter an input error. 
5.4.3. Range for Statement 

The new standard introduced a simpler for statement that can be used to iterate through the elements of a container or other sequence. The syntactic form of the range 
for 
statement 
is: 
for (declaration : expression) statement 

expression must represent a sequence, such as a braced initializer list (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 98), an array (¬ß 3.5, p. 113), or an object of a type such as vector or string that has begin and end members that return iterators (¬ß 3.4, p. 106). 
declaration defines a variable. It must be possible to convert each element of the sequence to the variable's type (¬ß 4.11, p. 159). The easiest way to ensure that the 
Exercises Section 5.4.2 
Exercise 5.15: Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you detect. 
(a) 
for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix) { /* ... */ } 

if (ix != sz) // ... 

(b) 
int ix; for (ix != sz; ++ix) { /* ... */ } 

(c) 
for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix, ++ sz) { /* ... */ } 


Exercise 5.16: The while loop is particularly good at executing while some condition holds; for example, when we need to read values until end-of-file. The for loop is generally thought of as a step loop: An index steps through a range of values in a collection. Write an idiomatic use of each loop and then rewrite each using the other loop construct. If you could use only one loop, which would you choose? Why? 
Exercise 5.17: Given two vectors of ints, write a program to determine whether one vector is a prefix of the other. For vectors of unequal length, compare the number of elements of the smaller vector. For example, given the vectors containing 0, 1, 1, and 2 and 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, respectively your program should return true. 
types match is to use the auto type specifier (¬ß 2.5.2, p. 68). That way the compiler will deduce the type for us. If we want to write to the elements in the sequence, the loop variable must be a reference type. 
On each iteration, the control variable is defined and initialized by the next value in the sequence, after which statement is executed. As usual, statement can be a single statement or a block. Execution ends once all the elements have been processed. 
We have already seen several such loops, but for completeness, here is one that doubles the value of each element in a vector: 
vector<int> v = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; 
// range variable must be a reference so we can write to the elements 
for (auto &r : v) // for each element in v 
r *= 2; // double the value of each element in v 
The for header declares the loop control variable, r, and associates it with v. We use auto to let the compiler infer the correct type for r. Because we want to change the value of the elements in v, we declare r as a reference. When we assign to r inside the loop, that assignment changes the element to which r is bound. 
A range for is defined in terms of the equivalent traditional for: 
for (auto beg = v.begin(), end = v.end(); beg != end; ++beg) { auto &r = *beg; // r must be a reference so we can change the element r *= 2; // double the value of each element in v } 
Now that we know how a range for works, we can understand why we said in ¬ß 3.3.2 
(p. 101) that we cannot use a range for to add elements to a vector (or other container). In a range for, the value of end() is cached. If we add elements to (or remove them from) the sequence, the value of end might be invalidated (¬ß 3.4.1, p. 110). We'll have more to say about these matters in ¬ß 9.3.6 
(p. 353). 
5.4.4. The do while Statement 
A do 
while 
statement 
is like a while but the condition is tested after the statement body completes. Regardless of the value of the condition, we execute the loop at least once. The syntactic form is as follows: 
do 
statement while (condition); 

Note 
A do while ends with a semicolon after the parenthesized condition. 
In a do, statement is executed before condition is evaluated. condition cannot be empty. If condition evaluates as false, then the loop terminates; otherwise, the loop is repeated. Variables used in condition must be defined outside the body of the do while statement. 
We can write a program that (indefinitely) does sums using a do while: 
// repeatedly ask the user for a pair of numbers to sum 
string rsp; // used in the condition; can't be defined inside the do 
do { 
cout << "please enter two values: "; 
int val1 = 0, val2 = 0; 
cin >> val1 >> val2; 
cout << "The sum of " << val1 << " and " << val2 
<< " = " << val1 + val2 << "\n\n" 
<< "More? Enter yes or no: "; 
cin >> rsp; 
} while (!rsp.empty() && rsp[0] != 'n'); The loop starts by prompting the user for two numbers. It then prints their sum and asks whether the user wishes to do another sum. The condition checks that the user gave a response. If not, or if the input starts with an n, the loop is exited. Otherwise the loop is repeated. 
Because the condition is not evaluated until after the statement or block is executed, the do while loop does not allow variable definitions inside the condition: 
do { // ... mumble(foo); 
} while (int foo = get_foo()); // error: declaration in a do condition 
If we could define variables in the condition, then any use of the variable would happen before the variable was defined! 
Exercises Section 5.4.4 
Exercise 5.18: Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you detect. 
(a) do int v1, v2; cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ; if (cin >> v1 >> v2) 
cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl; while (cin); 
(b) do { 
// ... } while (int ival = get_response()); 
(c) do { 
int ival = get_response(); } while (ival); 
Exercise 5.19: Write a program that uses a do while loop to repetitively request two strings from the user and report which string is less than the other. 
5.5. Jump Statements 
Jump statements interrupt the flow of execution. C++ offers four jumps: break, continue, and goto, which we cover in this chapter, and the return statement, which we'll describe in ¬ß 6.3 
(p. 222). 
5.5.1. The break Statement 
A break 
statement 
terminates the nearest enclosing while, do while, for, or switch statement. Execution resumes at the statement immediately following the terminated statement. 
A break can appear only within an iteration statement or switch statement (including inside statements or blocks nested inside such loops). A break affects only the nearest enclosing loop or switch: 
string buf; 
while (cin >> buf && !buf.empty()) { 
switch(buf[0]) { 
case '-': 
// process up to the first blank 
for (auto it = buf.begin()+1; it != buf.end(); ++it) 
{ 
if (*it == '') 
break; // #1, leaves the for loop 
// ... 
} 
// break #1 transfers control here 
// remaining '-' processing: 
break; // #2, leaves the switch statement 
case '+': // ... } // end switch // end of switch: break #2 transfers control here 
} // end while 
The break labeled #1 terminates the for loop that follows the hyphen case label. It does not terminate the enclosing switch statement and in fact does not even terminate the processing for the current case. Processing continues with the first statement following the for, which might be additional code to handle a hyphen or the break that completes that section. 
The break labeled #2 terminates the switch but does not terminate the enclosing while loop. Processing continues after that break by executing the condition in the while. 
Exercises Section 5.5.1 Exercise 5.20: Write a program to read a sequence of strings from the standard input until either the same word occurs twice in succession or all the words have been read. Use a while loop to read the text one word at a time. Use the break statement to terminate the loop if a word occurs twice in succession. Print the word if it occurs twice in succession, or else print a message saying that no word was repeated. 

#### 5.5.2. The `continue` Statement 

A continue 
statement 
terminates the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and immediately begins the next iteration. A continue can appear only inside a for, while, or do while loop, including inside statements or blocks nested inside such loops. Like the break statement, a continue inside a nested loop affects only the nearest enclosing loop. Unlike a break,a continue may appear inside a switch only if that switch is embedded inside an iterative statement. 
A continue interrupts the current iteration; execution stays inside the loop. In the case of a while or a do while, execution continues by evaluating the condition. In a traditional for loop, execution continues at the expression inside the for header. In a range for, execution continues by initializing the control variable from the next element in the sequence. 
For example, the following loop reads the standard input one word at a time. Only words that begin with an underscore will be processed. For any other value, we terminate the current iteration and get the next input: 
string buf; while (cin >> buf && !buf.empty()) { if (buf[0] != '_') continue; // get another input // still here? the input starts with an underscore; process buf ... } 
Exercises Section 5.5.2 Exercise 5.21: Revise the program from the exercise in ¬ß 
5.5.1 
(p. 191) so that it looks only for duplicated words that start with an uppercase letter. 

#### 5.5.3. The `goto` Statement 

A goto 
statement 
provides an unconditional jump from the goto to a another statement in the same function. 

Best Practices 
Programs should not use gotos. gotos make programs hard to understand and hard to modify. 
The syntactic form of a goto statement is 
goto label; 
where label is an identifier that identifies a statement. A labeled 
statement 
is any statement that is preceded by an identifier followed by a colon: 
end: return; // labeled statement; may be the target of a goto 
Label identifiers are independent of names used for variables and other identifiers. Hence, a label may have the same identifier as another entity in the program without interfering with the other uses of that identifier. The goto and the labeled statement to which it transfers control must be in the same function. 
As with a switch statement, a goto cannot transfer control from a point where an initialized variable is out of scope to a point where that variable is in scope: 
// ... 
goto end; 
int ix = 10; // error: goto bypasses an initialized variable 
definition 
end: 
// error: code here could use ix but the goto bypassed its declaration 
ix = 42; 
A jump backward over an already executed definition is okay. Jumping back to a point before a variable is defined destroys the variable and constructs it again: 
// backward jump over an initialized variable definition is okay 
begin: 
int sz = get_size(); 
if (sz <= 0) { 
goto begin; 
} 
Here sz is destroyed when the goto executes. It is defined and initialized anew when control passes back through its definition 
after the jump back to begin. 
Exercises Section 5.5.3 Exercise 5.22: The last example in this section that jumped back to begin could be better written using a loop. Rewrite the code to eliminate the goto. 

### 5.6. try Blocks and Exception Handling 

Exceptions are run-time anomalies‚Äîsuch as losing a database connection or encountering unexpected input‚Äîthat exist outside the normal functioning of a program. Dealing with anomalous behavior can be one of the most difficult parts of designing any system.

Exception handling is generally used when one part of a program detects a problem that it cannot resolve and the problem is such that the detecting part of the program cannot continue. In such cases, the detecting part needs a way to signal that something happened and that it cannot continue. Moreover, the detecting part needs a way to signal the problem without knowing what part of the program will deal with the exceptional condition. Having signaled what happened, the detecting part stops processing. 

A program that contains code that might raise an exception (usually) has another part to handle whatever happened. For example, if the problem is invalid input, the handling part might ask the user to provide correct input. If the database was lost, the handling part might alert an operator. 

Exception handling supports this cooperation between the detecting and handling parts of a program. In C++, exception handling involves 
. 
throw 
expressions, which the detecting part uses to indicate that it encountered something it can't handle. We say that a throw raises 
an exception. 

. 
try 
blocks, which the handling part uses to deal with an exception. A try block starts with the keyword try and ends with one or more catch 
clauses. Exceptions thrown from code executed inside a try block are usually handled by one of the catch clauses. Because they 'handle' the 

exception, 
catch 
clauses 
are 
also 
known 
as 
exception 
handlers. 


. 
A set of exception 
classes 
that are used to pass information about what happened between a throw and an associated catch. 

In the remainder of this section, we'll introduce these three components of exception handling. We'll also have more to say about exceptions in ¬ß 18.1 
(p. 772). 
5.6.1. A throw Expression 
The detecting part of a program uses a throw expression to raise an exception. A throw consists of the keyword throw followed by an expression. The type of the expression determines what kind of exception is thrown. A throw expression is usually followed by a semicolon, making it into an expression statement. 
As a simple example, recall the program in ¬ß 1.5.2 
(p. 23) that added two objects of type Sales_item. That program checked whether the records it read referred to the same book. If not, it printed a message and exited. 
Sales_item item1, item2; cin >> item1 >> item2; // first check that item1 and item2 represent the same book 
if (item1.isbn() == item2.isbn()) { cout << item1 + item2 << endl; return 0; // indicate success 
} else { cerr << "Data must refer to same ISBN" << endl; return -1; // indicate failure } 
In a more realistic program, the part that adds the objects might be separated from the part that manages the interaction with a user. In this case, we might rewrite the test to throw an exception rather than returning an error indicator: 
// first check that the data are for the same item if (item1.isbn() != item2.isbn()) 
throw runtime_error("Data must refer to same ISBN"); // if we're still here, the ISBNs are the same cout << item1 + item2 << endl; 
In this code, if the ISBNs differ, we throw an expression that is an object of type runtime_error. Throwing an exception terminates the current function and transfers control to a handler that will know how to handle this error. 
The type runtime_error is one of the standard library exception types and is defined in the stdexcept header. We'll have more to say about these types in ¬ß 5.6.3 
(p. 197). We must initialize a runtime_error by giving it a string or a C-style character string (¬ß 3.5.4, p. 122). That string provides additional information about the problem. 
5.6.2. The try Block 
The general form of a try block is 
try { 
program-statements } catch (exception-declaration){ handler-statements } catch (exception-declaration){ handler-statements } // ... 
A try block begins with the keyword try followed by a block, which, as usual, is a sequence of statements enclosed in curly braces. 
Following the try block is a list of one or more catch clauses. A catch consists of three parts: the keyword catch, the declaration of a (possibly unnamed) object within parentheses (referred to as an exception 
declaration), and a block. When a catch is selected to handle an exception, the associated block is executed. Once the catch finishes, execution continues with the statement immediately following the last catch clause of the try block. 
The program-statements inside the try constitute the normal logic of the program. Like any other blocks, they can contain any C++ statement, including declarations. As with any block, variables declared inside a try block are inaccessible outside the block'in particular, they are not accessible to the catch clauses. 
Writing a Handler 
In the preceding example, we used a throw to avoid adding two Sales_items that represented different books. We imagined that the part of the program that added two Sales_items was separate from the part that communicated with the user. The part that interacts with the user might contain code something like the following to handle the exception that was thrown: 
while (cin >> item1 >> item2) { try { // execute code that will add the two Sales_items // if the addition fails, the code throws a runtime_error exception } catch (runtime_error err) { // remind the user that the ISBNs must match and prompt for another pair 
cout << err.what() 
<< "\nTry Again? Enter y or n" << endl; 
char c; 
cin >> c; 
if (!cin || c == 'n') 
break; // break out of the while loop } } 
The ordinary logic of the program that manages the interaction with the user appears inside the try block. This part of the program is wrapped inside a try because it might throw an exception of type runtime_error. 
This try block has a single catch clause, which handles exceptions of type runtime_error. The statements in the block following the catch are executed if code inside the try block throws a runtime_error. Our catch handles the error by printing a message and asking the user to indicate whether to continue. If the user enters 'n', then the break is executed and we exit the while. Otherwise, execution falls through to the closing brace of the while, which transfers control back to the while condition for the next iteration. 
The prompt to the user prints the return from err.what(). We know that err has type runtime_error, so we can infer that what is a member function (¬ß 1.5.2, p. 23) of the runtime_error class. Each of the library exception classes defines a member function named what. These functions take no arguments and return a C-style character string (i.e., a const char*). The what member of runtime_error returns a copy of the string used to initialize the particular object. If the code described in the previous section threw an exception, then this catch would print 
Data must refer to same ISBN 
Try Again? Enter y or n 
Functions Are Exited during the Search for a Handler 
In complicated systems, the execution path of a program may pass through multiple try blocks before encountering code that throws an exception. For example, a try block might call a function that contains a try, which calls another function with its own try, and so on. 
The search for a handler reverses the call chain. When an exception is thrown, the function that threw the exception is searched first. If no matching catch is found, that function terminates. The function that called the one that threw is searched next. If no handler is found, that function also exits. 
That function's caller is searched next, and so on back up the execution path until a catch of an appropriate type is found. 
If no appropriate catch is found, execution is transferred to a library function named terminate. The behavior of that function is system dependent but is guaranteed to stop further execution of the program. 
Exceptions that occur in programs that do not define any try blocks are handled in the same manner: After all, if there are no try blocks, there can be no handlers. If a program has no try blocks and an exception occurs, then terminate is called and the program is exited. 
Caution: Writing Exception Safe Code is Hard 
It is important to realize that exceptions interrupt the normal flow of a program. At the point where the exception occurs, some of the computations that the caller requested may have been done, while others remain undone. In general, bypassing part of the program might mean that an object is left in an invalid or incomplete state, or that a resource is not freed, and so on. Programs that properly 'clean up' during exception handling are said to be exception 
safe. 
Writing exception safe code is surprisingly hard, and (largely) beyond the scope of this language Primer. 
Some programs use exceptions simply to terminate the program when an exceptional condition occurs. Such programs generally don't worry about exception safety. 
Programs that do handle exceptions and continue processing generally must be constantly aware of whether an exception might occur and what the program must do to ensure that objects are valid, that resources don't leak, and that the program is restored to an appropriate state. 
We will occasionally point out particularly common techniques used to promote exception safety. However, readers whose programs require robust exception handling should be aware that the techniques we cover are insufficient by themselves to achieve exception safety. 
5.6.3. Standard Exceptions 
The C++ library defines several classes that it uses to report problems encountered in the functions in the standard library. These exception classes are also intended to be used in the programs we write. These classes are defined in four headers: 
. 
The exception header defines the most general kind of exception class named exception. It communicates only that an exception occurred but provides no additional information. 

. 
The stdexcept header defines several general-purpose exception classes, which are listed in Table 
5.1. 


<stdexcept> 

. 
The new header defines the bad_alloc exception type, which we cover in ¬ß 12.1.2 
(p. 458). 

. 
The type_info header defines the bad_cast exception type, which we cover in ¬ß 19.2 
(p. 825). 


The library exception classes have only a few operations. We can create, copy, and assign objects of any of the exception types. 
We can only default initialize (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43) exception, bad_alloc, and bad_cast objects; it is not possible to provide an initializer for objects of these exception types. 
The other exception types have the opposite behavior: We can initialize those objects from either a string or a C-style string, but we cannot default initialize them. When we create objects of any of these other exception types, we must supply an initializer. That initializer is used to provide additional information about the error that occurred. 
The exception types define only a single operation named what. That function takes no arguments and returns a const char* that points to a C-style character string (¬ß 3.5.4, p. 122). The purpose of this C-style character string is to provide some sort of textual description of the exception thrown. 
The contents of the C-style string that what returns depends on the type of the exception object. For the types that take a string initializer, the what function returns that string. For the other types, the value of the string that what returns varies by compiler. 
Exercises Section 5.6.3 Exercise 5.23: Write a program that reads two 
integers from the standard input and prints the result of dividing the first number by the second. Exercise 5.24: Revise your program to throw an 
exception if the second number is zero. Test your program with a zero input to see what happens on your system if you don't catch an exception. 
Exercise 5.25: Revise your program from the previous exercise to use a try block to catch the exception. The catch clause should print a message to the user and ask them to supply a new number and repeat the code inside the try. 

Chapter Summary 
C++ provides a limited number of statements. Most of these affect the flow of control within a program: 
. 
while, for, and do while statements, which provide iterative execution. 

. 
if and switch, which provide conditional execution. 

. 
continue, which stops the current iteration of a loop. 

. 
break, which exits a loop or switch statement. 

. 
goto, which transfers control to a labeled statement. 

. 
try and catch, which define a try block enclosing a sequence of statements that might throw an exception. The catch clause(s) are intended to handle the exception(s) that the enclosed code might throw. 

. 
throw expression statements, which exit a block of code, transferring control to an associated catch clause. 

. 
return, which stops execution of a function. (We'll cover return statements in Chapter 
6.) 


In addition, there are expression statements and declaration statements. An expression statement causes the subject expression to be evaluated. Declarations and definitions of variables were described in Chapter 
2. 
Defined Terms 
block 
Sequence of zero or more statements enclosed in curly braces. A block is a statement, so it can appear anywhere a statement is expected. 
break 
statement 
Terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Execution transfers to the first statement following the terminated loop or switch. 
case 
label 
Constant expression (¬ß 2.4.4, p. 65) that follows the keyword case in a switch statement. No two case labels in the same switch statement may have the same value. 
catch 
clause 
The catch keyword, an exception declaration in parentheses, and a block of statements. The code inside a catch clause does whatever is necessary to handle an exception of the type defined in its exception declaration. 
compound 
statement 
Synonym for block. 
continue 
statement 
Terminates the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Execution transfers to the loop condition in a while or do, to the next iteration in a range for, or to the expression in the header of a traditional for loop. 
dangling 
else 
Colloquial term used to refer to the problem of how to process nested if statements in which there are more ifs than elses. In C++, an else is always paired with the closest preceding unmatched if. Note that curly braces can be used to effectively hide an inner if so that the programmer can control which if a given else should match. 
default 
label 
case label that matches any otherwise unmatched value computed in the switch expression. 
do 
while 
statement 
Like a while, except that the condition is tested at the end of the loop, not the beginning. The statement inside the do is executed at least once. 
exception 
classes 
Set of classes defined by the standard library to be used to represent errors. Table 
5.1 
(p. 197) lists the general-purpose exception classes. 
exception 
declaration 
The declaration in a catch clause. This declaration specifies the type of exceptions the catch can handle. 
exception 
handler 
Code that deals with an exception raised in another part of the program. Synonym for catch clause. 
exception 
safe 
Term used to describe programs that behave correctly when exceptions are thrown. 
expression 
statement 
An expression followed by a semicolon. An expression statement causes the expression to be evaluated. 
flow 
of 
control 
Execution path through a program. 
for 
statement 
Iteration statement that provides iterative execution. Ordinarily used to step through a container or to repeat a calculation a given number of times. 
goto 
statement 
Statement that causes an unconditional transfer of control to a specified labeled statement elsewhere in the same function. gotos obfuscate the flow of control within a program and should be avoided. 
if 
else 
statement 
Conditional execution of code following the if or the else, depending on the truth value of the condition. 
if 
statement 
Conditional execution based on the value of the specified condition. If the condition is true, then the if 
body is executed. If not, control flows to the statement following the if. 
labeled 
statement 
Statement preceded by a label. A label is an identifier followed by a colon. Label identifiers are independent of other uses of the same identifier. 
null 
statement 
An empty statement. Indicated by a single semicolon. 
raise 
Often used as a synonym for throw. C++ programmers speak of 'throwing' or 'raising' an exception interchangeably. 
range 
for 
statement 
Statement that iterates through a sequence. 
switch 
statement 
A conditional statement that starts by evaluating the expression that follows the switch keyword. Control passes to the labeled statement with a case label that matches the value of the expression. If there is no matching label, execution either continues at the default label, if there is one, or falls out of the switch if there is no default label. 
terminate 
Library function that is called if an exception is not caught. terminate aborts the program. 
throw 
expression 
Expression that interrupts the current execution path. Each throw throws an object and transfers control to the nearest enclosing catch clause that can handle the type of exception that is thrown. 
try 
block 
Block enclosed by the keyword try and one or more catch clauses. If the code inside a try block raises an exception and one of the catch clauses matches the type of the exception, then the exception is handled by that catch. Otherwise, the exception is handled by an enclosing try block or the program terminates. 
while 
statement 
Iteration statement that executes its target statement as long as a specified condition is true. The statement is executed zero or more times, depending on the truth value of the condition. 
## Chapter 6. Functions 
This chapter describes how to define and declare functions. We‚Äôll cover how arguments are passed to and values returned from functions. In C++, functions can be overloaded, which means that we can use the same name for several different functions. We‚Äôll cover both how to overload functions and how the compiler selects the matching version for a particular call from several overloaded functions. The chapter closes by describing pointers to functions.

A *function* is a block of code with a name. We execute the code by calling the function. A function may take zero or more arguments and (usually) yields a result. Functions can be overloaded, meaning that the same name may refer to several different functions.

### 6.1. Function Basics 

üìñA **function** definition typically consists of a **return type**, a name, a list of zero or more parameters, and a body. The **parameters** are specified in a comma-separated list enclosed in parentheses. The actions that the function performs are specified in a statement block (¬ß 5.1, p. 173), referred to as the **function body**.

We execute a function through the **call operator**, which is a pair of parentheses. The call operator takes an expression that is a function or points to a function. Inside the parentheses is a comma-separated list of **arguments**. The arguments are used to initialize the function‚Äôs parameters. The type of a call expression is the return type of the function.

##### Writing a Function

As an example, we‚Äôll write a function to determine the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number n is the product of the numbers from 1 through n. The factorial of 5, for example, is 120.

```c++
1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
```

We might define this function as follows:

```C++
// factorial of val is val * (val - 1) * (val - 2) . . . * ((val - (val - 1)) * 1)
int fact(int val)
{
    int ret = 1; // local variable to hold the result as we calculate it
    while (val > 1)
        ret *= val--; // assign ret * val to ret and decrement val
    return ret; // return the result
}
```

Our function is named `fact`. It takes one `int` parameter and returns an `int` value. Inside the `while` loop, we compute the factorial using the postfix decrement operator (¬ß 4.5, p. 147) to reduce the value of `val` by 1 on each iteration. The `return` statement ends execution of `fact` and returns the value of `ret`.

##### Calling a Function

To call fact, we must supply an int value. The result of the call is also an int: 
int main() { int j = fact(5); // j equals 120, i.e., the result of fact(5) 
cout << "5! is " << j << endl; return 0; } 
A function call does two things: It initializes the function's parameters from the corresponding arguments, and it transfers control to that function. Execution of the calling function is suspended and execution of the called function begins. 
Execution of a function begins with the (implicit) definition and initialization of its parameters. Thus, when we call fact, the first thing that happens is that an int variable named val is created. This variable is initialized by the argument in the call to fact, which in this case is 5. 
Execution of a function ends when a return statement is encountered. Like a function call, the return statement does two things: It returns the value (if any) in the return, and it transfers control out of the called function back to the calling function. The value returned by the function is used to initialize the result of the call expression. Execution continues with whatever remains of the expression in which the call appeared. Thus, our call to fact is equivalent to the following: 
int val =5; // initialize val from the literal 5 
int ret =1; // code from the body of fact while (val > 1) ret *= val--; int j=ret; // initialize j as a copy of ret 
Parameters and Arguments 
Arguments are the initializers for a function's parameters. The first argument initializes the first parameter, the second argument initializes the second parameter, and so on. Although we know which argument initializes which parameter, we have no guarantees about the order in which arguments are evaluated (¬ß 4.1.3, p. 137). The compiler is free to evaluate the arguments in whatever order it prefers. 
The type of each argument must match the corresponding parameter in the same way that the type of any initializer must match the type of the object it initializes. We must pass exactly the same number of arguments as the function has parameters. Because every call is guaranteed to pass as many arguments as the function has parameters, parameters are always initialized. 
Because fact has a single parameter of type int, every time we call it we must supply a single argument that can be converted (¬ß 4.11, p. 159) to int: 
fact("hello"); // error: wrong argument type 
fact(); // error: too few arguments 
fact(42, 10, 0); // error: too many arguments 
fact(3.14); // ok: argument is converted to int 
The first call fails because there is no conversion from const char* to int. The second and third calls pass the wrong number of arguments. The fact function must be called with one argument; it is an error to call it with any other number. The last call is legal because there is a conversion from double to int. In this call, the argument is implicitly converted to int (through truncation). After the conversion, this call is equivalent to 
fact(3); 
Function Parameter List 
A function's parameter list can be empty but cannot be omitted. Typically we define a function with no parameters by writing an empty parameter list. For compatibility with C, we also can use the keyword void to indicate that there are no parameters: 
void f1(){ /* ... */ } // implicit void parameter list 
void f2(void){ /* ... */ } // explicit void parameter list 
A parameter list typically consists of a comma-separated list of parameters, each of which looks like a declaration with a single declarator. Even when the types of two parameters are the same, the type must be repeated: 
int f3(int v1, v2) { /* ... */ } // error 
int f4(int v1, int v2) { /* ... */ } // ok 
No two parameters can have the same name. Moreover, local variables at the outermost scope of the function may not use the same name as any parameter. 
Parameter names are optional. However, there is no way to use an unnamed parameter. Therefore, parameters ordinarily have names. Occasionally a function has a parameter that is not used. Such parameters are often left unnamed, to indicate that they aren't used. Leaving a parameter unnamed doesn't change the number of arguments that a call must supply. A call must supply an argument for every parameter, even if that parameter isn't used. 
Function Return Type 
Most types can be used as the return type of a function. In particular, the return type can be void, which means that the 
function does not return a value. However, the return type may not be an array type (¬ß 3.5, p. 113) or a function type. However, a function may return a pointer to an array or a function. We'll see how to define functions that return pointers (or references) to arrays in ¬ß 6.3.3 
(p. 228) and how to return pointers to functions in ¬ß 6.7 
(p. 247). 
6.1.1. Local Objects 

In C++, names have scope (¬ß 2.2.4, p. 48), and objects have lifetimes. It is important to understand both of these concepts. 
. 
The scope of a name is the part of the program's text in which that name is visible. 

. 
The lifetime of an object is the time during the program's execution that the object exists. 


As we've seen, the body of a function is a statement block. As usual, the block forms a new scope in which we can define variables. Parameters and variables defined inside a function body are referred to as local 
variables. They are 'local' to that function and hide declarations of the same name made in an outer scope. 
Exercises Section 6.1 
Exercise 6.1: What is the difference between a parameter and an argument? Exercise 6.2: Indicate which of the following functions are 
in  error  and  why. Suggest  how  you  might  correct  the  
problems.

}  

(b) 
f2(int i) { /* ... */ } 

(c) 
int calc(int v1, int v1) /* ... */ } 

(d) 
double square(double x) return x * x; 


Exercise 6.3: Write and test your own version of fact. Exercise 6.4: Write a function that interacts with the user, 
asking for a number and generating the factorial of that number. Call this function from main. Exercise 6.5: Write a function to return the absolute value 
of its argument. 
Objects defined outside any function exist throughout the program's execution. Such objects are created when the program starts and are not destroyed until the program ends. The lifetime of a local variable depends on how it is defined. 
Automatic Objects 
The objects that correspond to ordinary local variables are created when the function's control path passes through the variable's definition. They are destroyed when control passes through the end of the block in which the variable is defined. Objects that exist only while a block is executing are known as automatic 
objects. After execution exits a block, the values of the automatic objects created in that block are undefined. 
Parameters are automatic objects. Storage for the parameters is allocated when the function begins. Parameters are defined in the scope of the function body. Hence they are destroyed when the function terminates. 
Automatic objects corresponding to the function's parameters are initialized by the arguments passed to the function. Automatic objects corresponding to local variables are initialized if their definition contains an initializer. Otherwise, they are default initialized (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43), which means that uninitialized local variables of built-in type have undefined values. 
Local static Objects 
It can be useful to have a local variable whose lifetime continues across calls to the function. We obtain such objects by defining a local variable as static. Each local 
static 
object 
is initialized before the first time execution passes through the object's definition. Local statics are not destroyed when a function ends; they are destroyed when the program terminates. 
As a trivial example, here is a function that counts how many times it is called: 
size_t count_calls() 
{ 
static size_t ctr = 0; // value will persist across calls 
return ++ctr; 
} 
int main() 
{ 
for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i) 
cout << count_calls() << endl; 
return 0; 
} 
This program will print the numbers from 1 through 10 inclusive. 
Before control flows through the definition of ctr for the first time, ctr is created and given an initial value of 0. Each call increments ctr and returns its new value. Whenever count_calls is executed, the variable ctr already exists and has whatever value was in that variable the last time the function exited. Thus, on the second invocation, the value of ctr is 1, on the third it is 2, and so on. 
If a local static has no explicit initializer, it is value initialized (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 98), meaning that local statics of built-in type are initialized to zero. 
Exercises Section 6.1.1 Exercise 6.6: Explain the differences between a parameter, a local variable, and a local static variable. 
Give an example of a function in which each might be useful. Exercise 6.7: Write a function that returns 0 when it is 
first called and then generates numbers in sequence each time it is called again. 
6.1.2. Function Declarations 

Like any other name, the name of a function must be declared before we can use it. As with variables (¬ß 2.2.2, p. 45), a function may be defined only once but may be declared multiple times. With one exception that we'll cover in ¬ß 15.3 
(p. 603), we can declare a function that is not defined so long as we never use that function. 
A function declaration is just like a function definition except that a declaration has no function body. In a declaration, a semicolon replaces the function body. 
Because a function declaration has no body, there is no need for parameter names. Hence, parameter names are often omitted in a declaration. Although parameter names are not required, they can be used to help users of the function understand what the function does: 
// parameter names chosen to indicate that the iterators denote a range of values to print 
void print(vector<int>::const_iterator beg, 
vector<int>::const_iterator end); 
These three elements'the return type, function name, and parameter types'describe the function's interface. They specify all the information we need to call the function. Function declarations are also known as the function 
prototype. 
Function Declarations Go in Header Files 
Recall that variables are declared in header files (¬ß 2.6.3, p. 76) and defined in source files. For the same reasons, functions should be declared in header files and defined in source files. 
It may be tempting'and would be legal'to put a function declaration directly in each source file that uses the function. However, doing so is tedious and error-prone. When we use header files for our function declarations, we can ensure that all the declarations for a given function agree. Moreover, if the interface to the function changes, only one declaration has to be changed. 
The source file that defines a function should include the header that contains that function's declaration. That way the compiler will verify that the definition and declaration are consistent. 

Best Practices 
The header that declares a function should be included in the source file that defines that function. 
Exercises Section 6.1.2 Exercise 6.8: Write a header file named Chapter6.h that contains declarations for the functions you wrote for the exercises in ¬ß 6.1 
(p. 205). 
6.1.3. Separate Compilation 

As our programs get more complicated, we'll want to store the various parts of the program in separate files. For example, we might store the functions we wrote for the exercises in ¬ß 6.1 
(p. 
205) in one file and store code that uses these functions in other source files. To allow programs to be written in logical parts, 
C++ 
supports 
what 
is 
commonly 
known 
as 
separate 
compilation. 
Separate 
compilation 
lets 
us 
split 
our 
programs into several files, each of which can be compiled independently. 
Compiling and Linking Multiple Source Files 
As an example, assume that the definition of our fact function is in a file named fact.cc and its declaration is in a header file named Chapter6.h. Our fact.cc file, like any file that uses these functions, will include the Chapter6.h header. We'll store a main function that calls fact in a second file named factMain.cc. To produce an executable 
file, we must tell the compiler where to find all of the code we use. We might compile these files as follows: 
$ CC factMain.cc fact.cc # generates factMain.exe or a.out $ CC factMain.cc fact.cc -o main # generates main or main.exe 
Here CC is the name of our compiler, $ is our system prompt, and # begins a command-line comment. We can now run the executable file, which will run our main function. 
If we have changed only one of our source files, we'd like to recompile only the file that actually changed. Most compilers provide a way to separately compile each file. This process usually yields a file with the .obj (Windows) or .o (UNIX) file extension, indicating that the file contains object 
code. 
The compiler lets us link 
object files together to form an executable. On the system we use, we would separately 
compile our program as follows: 
$  CC  -c  factMain.cc  #  generates  factMain.o  
$  CC  -c  fact.cc  #  generates  fact.o  
$  CC  factMain.o  fact.o  #  generates  factMain.exe  or  a.out  
$  CC  factMain.o  fact.o  -o  main  #  generates  main  or  main.exe  

You'll need to check with your compiler's user's guide to understand how to compile and execute programs made up of multiple source files. 
Exercises Section 6.1.3 Exercise 6.9: Write your own versions of the fact.cc and factMain.cc files. These files should include your Chapter6.h from the exercises in the previous section. Use these files to understand how your compiler supports separate compilation. 
6.2. Argument Passing 

As we've seen, each time we call a function, its parameters are created and initialized by the arguments passed in the call. 

Note 
Parameter initialization works the same way as variable initialization. 
As with any other variable, the type of a parameter determines the interaction between the parameter and its argument. If the parameter is a reference (¬ß 2.3.1, p. 50), then the parameter is bound to its argument. Otherwise, the argument's value is copied. 
When a parameter is a reference, we say that its corresponding argument is 'passed by reference' or that the function is 'called by reference.¬ß As with any other reference, a reference parameter is an alias for the object to which it is bound; that is, the parameter is an alias for its corresponding argument. 
When the argument value is copied, the parameter and argument are independent objects. We say such arguments are 'passed by value' or alternatively that the function is 'called by value.¬ß 
6.2.1. Passing Arguments by Value 

When we initialize a nonreference type variable, the value of the initializer is copied. Changes made to the variable have no effect on the initializer: 
int n=0; // ordinary variable of type intint i = n; // i is a copy of the value in n i = 42; // value in i is changed; n is unchanged 
Passing an argument by value works exactly the same way; nothing the function does to the parameter can affect the argument. For example, inside fact (¬ß 6.1, p. 202) the parameter val is decremented: 
ret *= val--; // decrements the value of val 
Although fact changes the value of val, that change has no effect on the argument passed to fact. Calling fact(i) does not change the value of i. 
Pointer Parameters 
Pointers (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 52) behave like any other nonreference type. When we copy a pointer, the value of the pointer is copied. After the copy, the two pointers are distinct. However, a pointer also gives us indirect access to the object to which that pointer points. We can change the value of that object by assigning through the pointer (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 55): 
int n= 0, i = 42; int *p = &n, *q = &i; // p points to n; q points to i *p =42; // value in n is changed; p is unchanged p=q; // p now points to i; values in i and n are unchanged 
The same behavior applies to pointer parameters: 
// function that takes a pointer and sets the pointed-to value to zero 
void reset(int *ip) 
{ 
*ip =0; // changes the value of the object to which ip points ip =0; // changes only the local copy of ip; the argument is unchanged 
} After a call to reset, the object to which the argument points will be 0, but the pointer argument itself is unchanged: 
int i= 42; reset(&i); // changes i but not the address of i cout << "i ="<< i<< endl; // prints i =0 

Best Practices 
Programmers accustomed to programming in C often use pointer parameters to access objects outside a function. In C++, programmers generally use reference parameters instead. 
Exercises Section 6.2.1 Exercise 6.10: Using pointers, write a function to swap the values of two ints. Test the function by calling it and printing the swapped values. 
6.2.2. Passing Arguments by Reference 

Recall that operations on a reference are actually operations on the object to which the reference refers (¬ß 2.3.1, p. 50): 
int n= 0, i = 42; int &r =n; // r is bound to n (i.e., r is another name for n) r = 42; // n is now 42 r=i; // n now has the same value as i i=r; // i has the same value as n 
Reference parameters exploit this behavior. They are often used to allow a function to change the value of one or more of its arguments. 
As one example, we can rewrite our reset program from the previous section to take a reference instead of a pointer: 
// function that takes a reference to an int and sets the given object to zero 
void reset(int &i) // i is just another name for the object passed to 
reset 
{ 
i=0; // changes the value of the object to which i refers 
} 
As with any other reference, a reference parameter is bound directly to the object from which it is initialized. When we call this version of reset, i will be bound to whatever int object we pass. As with any reference, changes made to i are made to the object to which i refers. In this case, that object is the argument to reset. 
When we call this version of reset, we pass an object directly; there is no need to pass its address: 
int j= 42; 
reset(j); // j is passed by reference; the value in j is changed 
cout << "j ="<< j << endl; // prints j=0 
In this call, the parameter i is just another name for j. Any use of i inside reset is a use of j. 
Using References to Avoid Copies 
It can be inefficient to copy objects of large class types or large containers. Moreover, some class types (including the IO types) cannot be copied. Functions must use reference parameters to operate on objects of a type that cannot be copied. 
As an example, we'll write a function to compare the length of two strings. Because strings can be long, we'd like to avoid copying them, so we'll make our parameters references. Because comparing two strings does not involve changing the strings, we'll make the parameters references to const (¬ß 2.4.1, p. 61): 
// compare the length of two strings 
bool isShorter(const string &s1, const string &s2) 
{ 
return s1.size() < s2.size(); 
} As we'll see in ¬ß 6.2.3 
(p. 213), functions should use references to const for reference parameters they do not need to change. 

Best Practices 
Reference parameters that are not changed inside a function should be references to const. 
Using Reference Parameters to Return Additional Information 
A function can return only a single value. However, sometimes a function has more than one value to return. Reference parameters let us effectively return multiple results. As an example, we'll define a function named find_char that will return the position of the first occurrence of a given character in a string. We'd also like the function to return a count of how many times that character occurs. 
How can we define a function that returns a position and an occurrence count? We could define a new type that contains the position and the count. An easier solution is to pass an additional reference argument to hold the occurrence count: 
// returns the index of the first occurrence of c in s 
// the reference parameter occurs counts how often c occurs 
string::size_type find_char(const string &s, char c, string::size_type &occurs) 
{ auto ret = s.size(); // position of the first occurrence, if any occurs = 0; // set the occurrence count parameter for (decltype(ret) i = 0; i != s.size(); ++i) { 
if (s[i] == c) { if (ret == s.size()) ret =i; // remember the first occurrence of c ++occurs; // increment the occurrence count 
} } return ret; // count is returned implicitly in occurs 
} When we call find_char, we have to pass three arguments: a string in which to look, the character to look for, and a size_type (¬ß 3.2.2, p. 88) object to hold the occurrence count. Assuming s is a string, and ctr is a size_type object, we can call find_char as follows: 
auto index = find_char(s, 'o', ctr); After the call, the value of ctr will be the number of times o occurs, and index will refer to the first occurrence if there is one. Otherwise, index will be equal to s.size() and ctr will be zero. 
Exercises Section 6.2.2 
Exercise 6.11: Write and test your own version of reset that takes a reference. Exercise 6.12: Rewrite the program from exercise 
6.10 

in ¬ß 6.2.1 
(p. 210) to use references instead of pointers to swap the value of two ints. Which version do you think would be easier to use and why? 
Exercise 6.13: Assuming T is the name of a type, explain the difference between a function declared as void f(T) and void f(T&). 
Exercise 6.14: Give an example of when a parameter should be a reference type. Give an example of when a parameter should not be a reference. 
Exercise 6.15: Explain the rationale for the type of each of find_char's parameters In particular, why is s a reference to const but occurs is a plain reference? Why are these parameters references, but the char parameter c is not? What would happen if we made s a plain reference? What if we made occurs a reference to const? 
6.2.3. const Parameters and Arguments 

When we use parameters that are const, it is important to remember the discussion of top-level const from ¬ß 2.4.3 
(p. 63). As we saw in that section, a top-level const is one that applies to the object itself: 
const int ci = 42; // we cannot change ci; const is top-level int i=ci; // ok: when we copy ci, its top-level const is ignored int *const p=&i; // const is top-level; we can't assign to p *p =0; // ok: changes through p are allowed; i is now 0 
Just as in any other initialization, when we copy an argument to initialize a parameter, top-level consts are ignored. As a result, top-level const on parameters are ignored. We can pass either a const or a nonconst object to a parameter that has a top-level const: 
void fcn(const int i) { /* fcn can read but not write to i */ } 
We can call fcn passing it either a const int or a plain int. The fact that top-level consts are ignored on a parameter has one possibly surprising implication: 
void fcn(const int i) { /* fcn can read but not write to i */ } void fcn(int i) { /* ... */ }// error: redefines fcn(int) 
In C++, we can define several different functions that have the same name. However, we can do so only if their parameter lists are sufficiently different. Because top-level consts are ignored, we can pass exactly the same types to either version of fcn. The second version of fcn is an error. Despite appearances, its parameter list doesn't differ from the list in the first version of fcn. 
Pointer or Reference Parameters and const 
Because parameters are initialized in the same way that variables are initialized, it can be helpful to remember the general initialization rules. We can initialize an object with a low-level const from a nonconst object but not vice versa, and a plain reference must be initialized from an object of the same type. 
int i= 42; const int *cp = &i; // ok: but cp can't change i (¬ß 2.4.2 (p. 62)) const int &r = i; // ok: but r can't change i (¬ß 2.4.1 (p. 61)) const int &r2 = 42; // ok: (¬ß 2.4.1 (p. 61)) int *p =cp; // error: types of p and cp don't match (¬ß 2.4.2 (p. 62)) int &r3 =r; // error: types of r3 and r don't match (¬ß 2.4.1 (p. 61)) int &r4 = 42; // error: can't initialize a plain reference from a literal (¬ß 2.3.1 (p. 50)) 
Exactly the same initialization rules apply to parameter passing: 
int i= 0; const int ci = i; string::size_type ctr = 0; 
reset(&i); // calls the version of reset that has an int* parameter reset(&ci); // error: can't initialize an int* from a pointer to a const int object reset(i); // calls the version of reset that has an int& parameter reset(ci); // error: can't bind a plain reference to the const object ci reset(42); // error: can't bind a plain reference to a literal reset(ctr); // error: types don't match; ctr has an unsigned type // ok: find_char's first parameter is a reference to const find_char("Hello World!", 'o', ctr); 
We can call the reference version of reset (¬ß 6.2.2, p. 210) only on int objects. We cannot pass a literal, an expression that evaluates to an int, an object that requires conversion, or a const int object. Similarly, we may pass only an int* to the pointer version of reset (¬ß 6.2.1, p. 209). On the other hand, we can pass a string literal as the first argument to find_char (¬ß 6.2.2, p. 211). That function's reference parameter is a reference to const, and we can initialize references to const from literals. 
Use Reference to const When Possible 

It is a somewhat common mistake to define parameters that a function does not change as (plain) references. Doing so gives the function's caller the misleading impression that the function might change its argument's value. Moreover, using a reference instead of a reference to const unduly limits the type of arguments that can be used with the function. As we've just seen, we cannot pass a const object, or a literal, or an object that requires conversion to a plain reference parameter. 
The effect of this mistake can be surprisingly pervasive. As an example, consider our find_char function from ¬ß 6.2.2 
(p. 211). That function (correctly) made its string parameter a reference to const. Had we defined that parameter as a plain string&: 
// bad design: the first parameter should be a const string& 
string::size_type find_char(string &s, char c, string::size_type &occurs); 
we could call find_char only on a string object. A call such as 
find_char("Hello World", 'o', ctr); 
would fail at compile time. 
More subtly, we could not use this version of find_char from other functions that (correctly) define their parameters as references to const. For example, we might want to use find_char inside a function that determines whether a string represents a sentence: 
bool is_sentence(const string &s) { // if there's a single period at the end of s, then s is a sentence 
string::size_type ctr = 0; return find_char(s, '.', ctr) == s.size() -1 && ctr == 1; } 
If find_char took a plain string&, then this call to find_char would be a compile-time error. The problem is that s is a reference to a const string, but find_char was (incorrectly) defined to take a plain reference. 
It might be tempting to try to fix this problem by changing the type of the parameter in is_sentence. But that fix only propagates the error'callers of is_sentence could pass only nonconst strings. 
The right way to fix this problem is to fix the parameter in find_char. If it's not possible to change find_char, then define a local string copy of s inside is_sentence and pass that string to find_char. 
6.2.4. Array Parameters 
Arrays have two special properties that affect how we define and use functions that operate on arrays: We cannot copy an array (¬ß 3.5.1, p. 114), and when we use an array it is (usually) converted to a pointer (¬ß 3.5.3, p. 117). Because we cannot copy an array, we cannot pass an array by value. Because arrays are converted to pointers, when we pass an array to a function, we are actually passing a pointer to the array's first element. 
Even though we cannot pass an array by value, we can write a parameter that looks like an array: 
Exercises Section 6.2.3 
Exercise 6.16: The following function, although legal, is less useful than it might be. Identify and correct the limitation on this function: 
bool is_empty(string& s) { return s.empty(); } 
Exercise 6.17: Write a function to determine whether a string contains any capital letters. Write a function to change a string to all lowercase. Do the parameters you used in these functions have the same type? If so, why? If not, why not? 
Exercise 6.18: Write declarations for each of the following functions. When you write these declarations, use the name of the function to indicate what the function does. 
(a) 
A function named compare that returns a bool and has two parameters that are references to a class named matrix. 

(b) 
A function named change_val that returns a vector<int> iterator and takes two parameters: One is an int and the other is an iterator for a vector<int>. 


Exercise 6.19: Given the following declarations, determine which calls are legal and which are illegal. For those that are illegal, explain why. 
double calc(double); int count(const string &, char); int sum(vector<int>::iterator, vector<int>::iterator, int); 
vector<int> vec(10); (a) calc(23.4, 55.1); 
(b) 
count("abcda", 'a'); (c) calc(66); 

(d) 
sum(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3.8); 


Exercise 6.20: When should reference parameters be references to const? What happens if we make a parameter a plain reference when it could be a reference to const? 
// despite appearances, these three declarations of print are equivalent 
// each function has a single parameter of type const int* 
void print(const int*); 
void print(const int[]); // shows the intent that the function takes an 
array 
void print(const int[10]); // dimension for documentation purposes 
(at best) 
Regardless of appearances, these declarations are equivalent: Each declares a function with a single parameter of type const int*. When the compiler checks a call to print, it checks only that the argument has type const int*: 
int i= 0, j[2] = {0, 1}; 
print(&i); // ok: &i is int* 
print(j); // ok: j is converted to an int* that points to j[0] 
If we pass an array to print, that argument is automatically converted to a pointer to the first element in the array; the size of the array is irrelevant. 

Warning 
As with any code that uses arrays, functions that take array parameters must ensure that all uses of the array stay within the array bounds. 

Because arrays are passed as pointers, functions ordinarily don't know the size of the array they are given. They must rely on additional information provided by the caller. There are three common techniques used to manage pointer parameters. 
Using a Marker to Specify the Extent of an Array 
The first approach to managing array arguments requires the array itself to contain an end marker. C-style character strings (¬ß 3.5.4, p. 122) are an example of this approach. C-style strings are stored in character arrays in which the last character of the string is followed by a null character. Functions that deal with C-style strings stop processing the array when they see a null character: 
void print(const char *cp) { if (cp) // if cp is not a null pointer while (*cp) // so long as the character it points to is not a null character cout << *cp++; // print the character and advance the pointer 
} 
This convention works well for data where there is an obvious end-marker value (like the null character) that does not appear in ordinary data. It works less well with data, such as ints, where every value in the range is a legitimate value. 
Using the Standard Library Conventions 
A 
second 
technique 
used 
to 
manage 
array 
arguments 
is 
to 
pass 
pointers 
to 
the 
first 
and 
one 
past 
the 
last 
element 
in 
the 
array. 
This 
approach 
is 
inspired 
by 
techniques 
used 
in 
the 
standard 
library. 
We'll 
learn 
more 
about 
this 
style 
of 
programming 
in 
Part 
II. 
Using 
this 
approach, 
we'll 
print 
the 
elements 
in 
an 
array 
as 
follows: 
void print(const int *beg, const int *end) { // print every element starting at beg up to but not including end 
while (beg != end) cout << *beg++ << endl; // print the current element // and advance the pointer } 
The while uses the dereference and postfix increment operators (¬ß 4.5, p. 148) to print the current element and advance beg one element at a time through the array. The loop stops when beg is equal to end. 
To call this function, we pass two pointers'one to the first element we want to print and one just past the last element: 
int j[2] = {0, 1}; // j is converted to a pointer to the first element in j // the second argument is a pointer to one past the end of j print(begin(j), end(j)); // begin and end functions, see ¬ß 3.5.3 (p. 118) 
This function is safe, as long as the caller correctly calculates the pointers. Here we let the library begin and end functions (¬ß 3.5.3, p. 118) provide those pointers. 
Explicitly Passing a Size Parameter 
A third approach for array arguments, which is common in C programs and older C++ programs, is to define a second parameter that indicates the size of the array. Using this approach, we'll rewrite print as follows: 
// const int ia[] is equivalent to const int* ia // size is passed explicitly and used to control access to elements of ia void print(const int ia[], size_t size) { 
for (size_t i = 0; i != size; ++i) { cout << ia[i] << endl; } } 
This version uses the size parameter to determine how many elements there are to print. When we call print, we must pass this additional parameter: 
int j[] ={0, 1}; // int array of size 2 
print(j, end(j) -begin(j)); 
The function executes safely as long as the size passed is no greater than the actual size of the array. 
Array Parameters and const 
Note that all three versions of our print function defined their array parameters as pointers to const. The discussion in ¬ß 6.2.3 

(p. 213) applies equally to pointers as to references. When a function does not need write access to the array elements, the array parameter should be a pointer to const (¬ß 2.4.2, p. 62). A parameter should be a plain pointer to a nonconst type only if the function needs to change element values. 
Array Reference Parameters 
Just as we can define a variable that is a reference to an array (¬ß 3.5.1, p. 114), we can define a parameter that is a reference to an array. As usual, the reference parameter is bound to the corresponding argument, which in this case is an array: 
// ok: parameter is a reference to an array; the dimension is part of the type 
void print(int (&arr)[10]) { for (auto elem : arr) cout << elem << endl; } 

Note 
The parentheses around &arr are necessary (¬ß 3.5.1, p. 114): 
f(int &arr[10]) // error: declares arr as an array of references f(int (&arr)[10]) // ok: arr is a reference to an array of ten ints 
Because the size of an array is part of its type, it is safe to rely on the dimension in the body of the function. However, the fact that the size is part of the type limits the usefulness of this version of print. We may call this function only for an array of exactly ten ints: 
int i= 0, j[2] = {0, 1}; 
int k[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; 
print(&i); // error: argument is not an array of ten ints 
print(j); // error: argument is not an array of ten ints 
print(k); // ok: argument is an array of ten ints 
We'll see in ¬ß 16.1.1 
(p. 654) how we might write this function in a way that would allow us to pass a reference parameter to an array of any size. 
Passing a Multidimensional Array 
Recall that there are no multidimensional arrays in C++ (¬ß 3.6, 
p. 125). Instead, what appears to be a multidimensional array is an array of arrays. 
As with any array, a multidimensional array is passed as a pointer to its first element (¬ß 3.6, p. 128). Because we are dealing with an array of arrays, that element is an array, so the pointer is a pointer to an array. The size of the second (and any subsequent) dimension is part of the element type and must be specified: 
// matrix points to the first element in an array whose elements are arrays of ten ints void print(int (*matrix)[10], int rowSize) { /* ... */ } 
declares matrix as a pointer to an array of ten ints. 

Note 
Again, the parentheses around *matrix are necessary: 
int *matrix[10]; // array of ten pointers int (*matrix)[10]; // pointer to an array of ten ints 
We can also define our function using array syntax. As usual, the compiler ignores the first dimension, so it is best not to include it: 
// equivalent definition 
void print(int matrix[][10], int rowSize) { /* ... */ } 
declares matrix to be what looks like a two-dimensional array. In fact, the parameter is a pointer to an array of ten ints. 
6.2.5. main: Handling Command-Line Options 
It turns out that main is a good example of how C++ programs pass arrays to functions. Up to now, we have defined main with an empty parameter list: 
int main() { ... } 
However, we sometimes need to pass arguments to main. The most common use of arguments to main is to let the user specify a set of options to guide the operation of the program. For example, assuming our main program is in an executable file named prog, we might pass options to the program as follows: 
Exercises Section 6.2.4 
Exercise 6.21: Write a function that takes an int and a pointer to an int and returns the larger of the int value or the value to which the pointer points. What type should you use for the pointer? 
Exercise 6.22: Write a function to swap two int pointers. 
Exercise 6.23: Write your own versions of each of the print functions presented in this section. Call each of these functions to print i and j defined as follows: 
int i= 0, j[2] = {0, 1}; 
Exercise 6.24: Explain the behavior of the following function. If there are problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them. 
void print(const int ia[10]) { for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i) cout << ia[i] << endl; } 
prog -d -o ofile data0 Such command-line options are passed to main in two (optional) parameters: 
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { ... } The second parameter, argv, is an array of pointers to C-style character strings. The first parameter, argc, passes the number of strings in that array. Because the second parameter is an array, we might alternatively define main as 
int main(int argc, char **argv) { ... } indicating that argv points to a char*. 
When arguments are passed to main, the first element in argv points either to the name of the program or to the empty string. Subsequent elements pass the arguments provided on the command line. The element just past the last pointer is guaranteed to be 0. 
Given the previous command line, argc would be 5, and argv would hold the following C-style character strings: 
argv[0] = "prog"; // or argv[0] might point to an empty string 
argv[1] = "-d"; argv[2] = "-o"; argv[3] = "ofile"; argv[4] = "data0"; argv[5] = 0; 

Warning 
When you use the arguments in argv, remember that the optional arguments begin in argv[1]; argv[0] contains the program's name, not user input. 
Exercises Section 6.2.5 Exercise 6.25: Write a main function that takes two 
arguments. Concatenate the supplied arguments and print the resulting string. Exercise 6.26: Write a program that accepts the options 
presented in this section. Print the values of the arguments passed to main. 
6.2.6. Functions with Varying Parameters 
Sometimes we do not know in advance how many arguments we need to pass to a function. For example, we might want to write a routine to print error messages generated from our program. We'd like to use a single function to print these error messages in order to handle them in a uniform way. However, different calls to our error-printing function might pass different arguments, corresponding to different kinds of error messages. 
The new standard provides two primary ways to write a function that takes a varying number of arguments: If all the arguments have the same type, we can pass a library type named initializer_list. If the argument types vary, we can write a special kind of function, known as a variadic template, which we'll cover in ¬ß 16.4 
(p. 699). 
C++ also has a special parameter type, ellipsis, that can be used to pass a varying number of arguments. We'll look briefly at ellipsis parameters in this section. However, it is worth noting that this facility ordinarily should be used only in programs that need to interface to C functions. 
initializer_list Parameters 

We can write a function that takes an unknown number of arguments of a single type by using an initializer_list 
parameter. An initializer_list is a library type that represents an array (¬ß 3.5, p. 113) of values of the specified type. This type is defined in the initializer_list header. The operations that initializer_list provides are listed in Table 
6.1. 
Table 6.1. Operations on initializer_lists 

Like a vector, initializer_list is a template type (¬ß 3.3, p. 96). When we define an initializer_list, we must specify the type of the elements that the list will contain: 
initializer_list<string> ls; // initializer_list of strings 
initializer_list<int> li; // initializer_list of ints 
Unlike vector, the elements in an initializer_list are always const values; there is no way to change the value of an element in an initializer_list. 
We can write our function to produce error messages from a varying number of arguments as follows: 
void error_msg(initializer_list<string> il) { for (auto beg = il.begin(); beg != il.end(); ++beg) cout << *beg << " "; cout << endl; } 
The begin and end operations on initializer_list objects are analogous to the corresponding vector members (¬ß 3.4.1, p. 106). The begin() member gives us a pointer to the first element in the list, and end() is an off-the-end pointer one past the last element. Our function initializes beg to denote the first element and iterates through each element in the initializer_list. In the body of the loop we dereference beg in order to access the current element and print its value. 
When we pass a sequence of values to an initializer_list parameter, we must enclose the sequence in curly braces: 
// expected, actual are strings 
if (expected != actual) error_msg({"functionX", expected, actual}); else error_msg({"functionX", "okay"}); 
Here we're calling the same function, error_msg, passing three values in the first call and two values in the second. 
A function with an initializer_list parameter can have other parameters as well. For example, our debugging system might have a class, named ErrCode, that represents various kinds of errors. We can revise our program to take an ErrCode in addition to an initializer_list as follows: 
void error_msg(ErrCode e, initializer_list<string> il) 
{ 
cout << e.msg() << ": "; 
for (const auto &elem : il) 
cout << elem << " "; 
cout << endl; 
} 
Because initializer_list has begin and end members, we can use a range for (¬ß 5.4.3, p. 187) to process the elements. This program, like our previous version, iterates an element at a time through the braced list of values passed to the il parameter. 
To call this version, we need to revise our calls to pass an ErrCode argument: 
if (expected != actual) error_msg(ErrCode(42), {"functionX", expected, actual}); else error_msg(ErrCode(0), {"functionX", "okay"}); 
Ellipsis Parameters 

Ellipsis parameters are in C++ to allow programs to interface to C code that uses a C library facility named varargs. Generally an ellipsis parameter should not be used for other purposes. Your C compiler documentation will describe how to use varargs. 

Warning 
Ellipsis parameters should be used only for types that are common to both C and C++. In particular, objects of most class types are not copied properly when passed to an ellipsis parameter. 
An ellipsis parameter may appear only as the last element in a parameter list and may take either of two forms: 
void foo(parm_list, ...); 
void foo(...); 
The first form specifies the type(s) for some of foo's parameters. Arguments that correspond to the specified parameters are type checked as usual. No type checking is done for the arguments that correspond to the ellipsis parameter. In this first form, the comma following the parameter declarations is optional. 
Exercises Section 6.2.6 Exercise 6.27: Write a function that takes an 
initializer_list<int> and produces the sum of the elements in the list. Exercise 6.28: In the second version of error_msg that 
has an ErrCode parameter, what is the type of elem in the 
for loop? Exercise 6.29: When you use an initializer_list in a range for would you ever use a reference as the loop control variable? If so, why? If not, why not? 

6.3. Return Types and the return Statement 
A return statement terminates the function that is currently executing and returns control to the point from which the function was called. There are two forms of return statements: 
return; return expression; 
6.3.1. Functions with No Return Value 

A return with no value may be used only in a function that has a return type of void. Functions that return void are not required to contain a return.In a void function, an implicit return takes place after the function's last statement. 
Typically, void functions use a return to exit the function at an intermediate point. This use of return is analogous to the use of a break statement (¬ß 5.5.1, p. 190) to exit a loop. For example, we can write a swap function that does no work if the values are identical: 
void swap(int &v1, int &v2) 
{ 
// if the values are already the same, no need to swap, just return 
if (v1 == v2) 
return; // if we're here, there's work to do int tmp = v2; v2 = v1; v1 = tmp; // no explicit return necessary 
} 
This function first checks if the values are equal and, if so, exits the function. If the values are unequal, the function swaps them. An implicit return occurs after the last assignment statement. 
A function with a void return type may use the second form of the return statement only to return the result of calling another function that returns void. Returning any other expression from a void function is a compile-time error. 
6.3.2. Functions That Return a Value 

The second form of the return statement provides the function's result. Every return in a function with a return type other than void must return a value. The value returned must have the same type as the function return type, or it must have a type that can be implicitly converted (¬ß 4.11, p. 159) to that type. 
Although C++ cannot guarantee the correctness of a result, it can guarantee that every return includes a result of the appropriate type. Although it cannot do so in all cases, the compiler attempts to ensure that functions that return a value are exited only through a valid return statement. For example: 
// incorrect return values, this code will not compile 
bool str_subrange(const string &str1, const string &str2) 
{ 
// same sizes: return normal equality test if (str1.size() == str2.size()) return str1 == str2; // ok: == returns bool // find the size of the smaller string; conditional operator, see ¬ß 4.7 (p. 151) 
auto size = (str1.size() < str2.size()) 
? str1.size() : str2.size(); 
// look at each element up to the size of the smaller string 
for (decltype(size) i = 0; i != size; ++i) { 
if (str1[i] != str2[i]) return; // error #1: no return value; compiler should detect this error 
} 
// error #2: control might flow off the end of the function without a return // the compiler might not detect this error } 
The return from within the for loop is an error because it fails to return a value. The compiler should detect this error. 
The second error occurs because the function fails to provide a return after the loop. If we call this function with one string that is a subset of the other, execution would fall out of the for. There should be a return to handle this case. The compiler may or may not detect this error. If it does not detect the error, what happens at run time is undefined. 

Warning 
Failing to provide a return after a loop that contains a return is an error. However, many compilers will not detect such errors. 
How Values Are Returned 
Values are returned in exactly the same way as variables and parameters are initialized: The return value is used to initialize a temporary at the call site, and that temporary is the result of the function call. 
It is important to keep in mind the initialization rules in functions that return local variables. As an example, we might write a function that, given a counter, a word, and an ending, gives us back the plural version of the word if the counter is greater than 1: 
// return the plural version of word if ctr is greater than 1 
string make_plural(size_t ctr, const string &word, const string &ending) 
{ return (ctr > 1) ? word + ending : word; } 
The return type of this function is string, which means the return value is copied to the call site. This function returns a copy of word, or it returns an unnamed temporary string that results from adding word and ending. 
As with any other reference, when a function returns a reference, that reference is just another name for the object to which it refers. As an example, consider a function that returns a reference to the shorter of its two string parameters: 
// return a reference to the shorter of two strings 
const string &shorterString(const string &s1, const string 
&s2) 
{ 
return s1.size() <= s2.size() ? s1 : s2; 
} 
The parameters and return type are references to const string. The strings are not copied when the function is called or when the result is returned. 
Never Return a Reference or Pointer to a Local Object 
When a function completes, its storage is freed (¬ß 6.1.1, p. 204). After a function terminates, references to local objects refer to memory that is no longer valid: 
// disaster: this function returns a reference to a local object 
const string &manip() 
{ 
string ret; 
// transform ret in some way 
if (!ret.empty()) 
return ret; // WRONG: returning a reference to a local object! 
else 
return "Empty"; // WRONG: "Empty" is a local temporary 
string 
} Both of these return statements return an undefined value' what happens if we try to use the value returned from manip is undefined. In the first return, it should be obvious that the function returns a reference to a local object. In the second case, the string literal is converted to a local temporary string object. That object, like the string named s, is local to manip. The storage in which the temporary resides is freed when the function ends. Both returns refer to memory that is no longer available. 

Tip 
One good way to ensure that the return is safe is to ask: To what preexisting object is the reference referring? 
For the same reasons that it is wrong to return a reference to a local object, it is also wrong to return a pointer to a local object. Once the function completes, the local objects are freed. The pointer would point to a nonexistent object. 
Functions That Return Class Types and the Call Operator 
Like any operator the call operator has associativity and precedence (¬ß 4.1.2, p. 136). The call operator has the same precedence as the dot and arrow operators (¬ß 4.6, p. 150). Like those operators, the call operator is left associative. As a result, if a function returns a pointer, reference or object of class type, we can use the result of a call to call a member of the resulting object. 
For example, we can determine the size of the shorter string as follows: 
// call the size member of the string returned by shorterString 
auto sz = shorterString(s1, s2).size(); 
Because these operators are left associative, the result of shorterString is the left-hand operand of the dot operator. That operator fetches the size member of that string. That member is the left-hand operand of the second call operator. 
Reference Returns Are Lvalues 
Whether a function call is an lvalue (¬ß 4.1.1, p. 135) depends on the return type of the function. Calls to functions that return references are lvalues; other return types yield rvalues. A call to a function that returns a reference can be used in the same ways as any other lvalue. In particular, we can assign to the result of a function that returns a reference to nonconst: 
char &get_val(string &str, string::size_type ix) { return str[ix]; // get_val assumes the given index is valid 
} 
int main() 
{ 
string s("a value"); 
cout << s << endl; // prints a value 
get_val(s, 0) = 'A'; // changes s[0] to A 
cout << s << endl; // prints A value 
return 0; 
} 
It may be surprising to see a function call on the left-hand side of an assignment. However, nothing special is involved. The return value is a reference, so the call is an lvalue. Like any other lvalue, it may appear as the left-hand operand of the assignment operator. 
If the return type is a reference to const, then (as usual) we may not assign to the result of the call: 
shorterString("hi", "bye") = "X"; // error: return value is const 
List Initializing the Return Value 

Under the new standard, functions can return a braced list of values. As in any other return, the list is used to initialize the temporary that represents the function's return. If the list is empty, that temporary is value initialized (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 98). Otherwise, the value of the return depends on the function's return type. 
As an example, recall the error_msg function from ¬ß 6.2.6 
(p. 220). That function took a varying number of string arguments and printed an error message composed from the given strings. Rather than calling error_msg, in this function we'll return a vector that holds the error-message strings: 
vector<string> process() { // ... // expected and actual are strings 
if (expected.empty()) return {}; // return an empty vector else if (expected == actual) return {"functionX", "okay"}; // return list-initialized vector else return {"functionX", expected, actual}; } 
In the first return statement, we return an empty list. In this case, the vector that process returns will be empty. Otherwise, we return a vector initialized with two or three elements depending on whether expected and actual are equal. 
In a function that returns a built-in type, a braced list may contain at most one value, and that value must not require a narrowing conversion (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43). If the function returns a class type, then the class itself defines how the intiailizers are used (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 99). 
Return from main 
There is one exception to the rule that a function with a return type other than void must return a value: The main function is allowed to terminate without a return. If control reaches the end of main and there is no return, then the compiler implicitly inserts a return of 0. 
As we saw in ¬ß 1.1 
(p. 2), the value returned from main is treated as a status indicator. A zero return indicates success; most other values indicate failure. A nonzero value has a machine-dependent meaning. To make return values machine independent, the cstdlib header defines two preprocessor variables (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 54) that we can use to indicate success or failure: 
int main() { if (some_failure) return EXIT_FAILURE; // defined in cstdlib 
else return EXIT_SUCCESS; // defined in cstdlib } 
Because these are preprocessor variables, we must not precede them with std::, nor may we mention them in using declarations. 
Recursion 
A function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly, is a recursive 
function. As an example, we can rewrite our factorial function to use recursion: 
// calculate val!, whichis 1*2*3...*val 
int factorial(int val) { if(val > 1) return factorial(val-1) * val; return 1; 
} In this implementation, we recursively call factorial to compute the factorial of the numbers counting down from the original value in val. Once we have reduced val to 1, we stop the recursion by returning 1. 
There must always be a path through a recursive function that does not involve a recursive call; otherwise, the function will recurse 'forever,¬ß meaning that the function will continue to call itself until the program stack is exhausted. Such functions are sometimes described as containing a recursion 
loop. In the case of factorial, the stopping condition occurs when val is 1. 
The following table traces the execution of factorial when passed the value 5. 


Note 
The main function may not call itself.

contents of a vector. Exercise 6.34: What would happen if the stopping condition in factorial were

Exercise 6.35: In the call to fact, why did we pass val -1 rather than val--? 
6.3.3. Returning a Pointer to an Array 
Because we cannot copy an array, a function cannot return an array. However, a function can return a pointer or a reference to an array (¬ß 3.5.1, p. 114). Unfortunately, the syntax used to define functions that return pointers or references to arrays can be intimidating. Fortunately, there are ways to simplify such declarations. The most straightforward way is to use a type alias (¬ß 2.5.1, p. 67): 
typedef int arrT[10]; // arrT is a synonym for the type array of ten ints using arrtT = int[10]; // equivalent declaration of arrT; see ¬ß 2.5.1 
(p. 68) 
arrT* func(int i); // func returns a pointer to an array of five ints Here arrT is a synonym for an array of ten ints. Because we cannot return an array, we define the return type as a pointer to this type. Thus, func is a function that takes a single int argument and returns a pointer to an array of ten ints. 
Declaring a Function That Returns a Pointer to an Array 
To declare func without using a type alias, we must remember that the dimension of an array follows the name being defined: 
int arr[10]; // arr is an array of ten ints 
int *p1[10]; // p1 is an array of ten pointers 
int (*p2)[10] = &arr; // p2 points to an array of ten ints 
As with these declarations, if we want to define a function that returns a pointer to an array, the dimension must follow the function's name. However, a function includes a parameter list, which also follows the name. The parameter list precedes the dimension. Hence, the form of a function that returns a pointer to an array is: 
Type (*function(parameter_list))[dimension] 
As in any other array declaration, Type is the type of the elements and dimension is the size of the array. The parentheses around (*function (parameter_list)) are necessary for the same reason that they were required when we defined p2. Without them, we would be defining a function that returns an array of pointers. 
As a concrete example, the following declares func without using a type alias: 
int (*func(int i))[10]; 
To understand this declaration, it can be helpful to think about it as follows: 
. 
func(int) says that we can call func with an int argument. 

. 
(*func(int)) says we can dereference the result of that call. 

. 
(*func(int))[10] says that dereferencing the result of a call to func yields an array of size ten. 

. 
int (*func(int))[10] says the element type in that array is int. 


Using a Trailing Return Type 

Under the new standard, another way to simplify the declaration of func is by using a trailing 
return 
type. Trailing returns can be defined for any function, but are most useful for functions with complicated return types, such as pointers (or references) to arrays. A trailing return type follows the parameter list and is preceded by ->. To signal that the return follows the parameter list, we use auto where the return type ordinarily appears: 
// fcn takes an int argument and returns a pointer to an array of ten ints 
auto func(int i) -> int(*)[10]; 
Because the return type comes after the parameter list, it is easier to see that func returns a pointer and that that pointer points to an array of ten ints. 


Using decltype 
As another alternative, if we know the array(s) to which our function can return a pointer, we can use decltype to declare the return type. For example, the following function returns a pointer to one of two arrays, depending on the value of its parameter: 
int odd[] = {1,3,5,7,9}; 
int even[] = {0,2,4,6,8}; 
// returns a pointer to an array of five int elements 
decltype(odd) *arrPtr(int i) 
{ 
return (i % 2) ? &odd : &even; // returns a pointer to the array 
} The return type for arrPtr uses decltype to say that the function returns a pointer to whatever type odd has. That object is an array, so arrPtr returns a pointer to an array of five ints. The only tricky part is that we must remember that decltype does not automatically convert an array to its corresponding pointer type. The type returned by decltype is an array type, to which we must add a * to indicate that arrPtr returns a pointer. 
Exercises Section 6.3.3 Exercise 6.36: Write the declaration for a function that 
returns a reference to an array of ten strings, without using either a trailing return, decltype, or a type alias. Exercise 6.37: Write three additional declarations for 
the function in the previous exercise. One should use a type alias, one should use a trailing return, and the third should use decltype. Which form do you prefer and why? 
Exercise 6.38: Revise the arrPtr function on to return a reference to the array. 
6.4. Overloaded Functions 

Functions that have the same name but different parameter lists and that appear in the same scope are overloaded. For example, in ¬ß 6.2.4 
(p. 214) we defined several functions named print: 
void print(const char *cp); 
void print(const int *beg, const int *end); 
void print(const int ia[], size_t size); 
These functions perform the same general action but apply to different parameter types. When we call these functions, the compiler can deduce which function we want based on the argument type we pass: 
int j[2] = {0,1}; 
print("Hello World"); // calls print(const char*) 
print(j, end(j) -begin(j)); // calls print(const int*, size_t) 
print(begin(j), end(j)); // calls print(const int*, const int*) 
Function overloading eliminates the need to invent'and remember'names that exist only to help the compiler figure out which function to call. 

Note 
The main function may not be overloaded. 
Defining Overloaded Functions 
Consider a database application with several functions to find a record based on name, phone number, account number, and so on. Function overloading lets us define a collection of functions, each named lookup, that differ in terms of how they do the search. We can call lookup passing a value of any of several types: 
Record lookup(const Account&);  // find by Account  
Record lookup(const Phone&);  // find by Phone  
Record lookup(const Name&);  // find by Name  
Account acct;  
Phone phone;  

Record r1 = lookup(acct); // call version that takes an Account 
Record r2 = lookup(phone); // call version that takes a Phone 
Here, all three functions share the same name, yet they are three distinct functions. The compiler uses the argument type(s) to figure out which function to call. 
Overloaded functions must differ in the number or the type(s) of their parameters. Each of the functions above takes a single parameter, but the parameters have different types. 
It is an error for two functions to differ only in terms of their return types. If the parameter lists of two functions match but the return types differ, then the second declaration is an error: 
Record lookup(const Account&); bool lookup(const Account&); // error: only the return type is different 
Determining Whether Two Parameter Types Differ 
Two parameter lists can be identical, even if they don't look the same: 
// each pair declares the same function 
Record lookup(const Account &acct); 
Record lookup(const Account&); // parameter names are ignored 
typedef Phone Telno; 
Record lookup(const Phone&); Record lookup(const Telno&); // Telno and Phone are the same type 
In the first pair, the first declaration names its parameter. Parameter names are only a documentation aid. They do not change the parameter list. 
In the second pair, it looks like the types are different, but Telno is not a new type; it is a synonym for Phone. A type alias (¬ß 2.5.1, p. 67) provides an alternative name for an existing type; it does not create a new type. Therefore, two parameters that differ only in that one uses an alias and the other uses the type to which the alias corresponds are not different. 
Overloading and const Parameters 

As we saw in ¬ß 6.2.3 
(p. 212), top-level const (¬ß 2.4.3, p. 63) has no effect on the objects that can be passed to the function. A parameter that has a top-level const is indistinguishable from one without a top-level const: 
Record lookup(Phone); Record lookup(const Phone); // redeclares Record lookup(Phone) 
Record lookup(Phone*); Record lookup(Phone* const); // redeclares Record lookup(Phone*) 
In these declarations, the second declaration declares the same function as the first. 
On the other hand, we can overload based on whether the parameter is a reference (or pointer) to the const or nonconst version of a given type; such consts are low-level: 
// functions taking const and nonconst references or pointers have different parameters // declarations for four independent, overloaded functions Record lookup(Account&); // function that takes a reference to Account Record lookup(const Account&); // new function that takes a const reference 
Record lookup(Account*); // new function, takes a pointer to Account Record lookup(const Account*); // new function, takes a pointer to const 
In these cases, the compiler can use the constness of the argument to distinguish which function to call. Because there is no conversion (¬ß 4.11.2, p. 162) from const, we can pass a const object (or a pointer to const) only to the version with a const parameter. Because there is a conversion to const, we can call either function on a nonconst object or a pointer to nonconst. However, as we'll see in ¬ß 6.6.1 
(p. 246), the compiler will prefer the nonconst versions when we pass a nonconst object or pointer to nonconst. 
const_cast and Overloading 
In ¬ß 4.11.3 
(p. 163) we noted that const_casts are most useful in the context of overloaded functions. As one example, recall our shorterString function from ¬ß 6.3.2 
(p. 224): 
// return a reference to the shorter of two strings 
const string &shorterString(const string &s1, const string &s2) { 
return s1.size() <= s2.size() ? s1 : s2; } 
Advice: When Not to Overload a Function Name Although overloading lets us avoid having to invent (and remember) names for common operations, we should only overload operations that actually do similar things. There 
are some cases where providing different function names adds information that makes the program easier to understand. Consider a set of functions that move the cursor on a Screen. 
Screen& moveHome(); Screen& moveAbs(int, int); Screen& moveRel(int, int, string direction); 
It might at first seem better to overload this set of functions under the name move: 
Screen& move(); Screen& move(int, int); Screen& move(int, int, string direction); 
However, by overloading these functions, we've lost information that was inherent in the function names. Although cursor movement is a general operation shared by all these functions, the specific nature of that movement is unique to each of these functions. moveHome, for example, represents a special instance of cursor movement. Whether to overload these functions depends on which of these two calls is easier to understand: 
// which is easier to understand? myScreen.moveHome(); // we think this one! myScreen.move(); 
This function takes and returns references to const string. We can call the function on a pair of nonconst string arguments, but we'll get a reference to a const string as the result. We might want to have a version of shorterString that, when given nonconst arguments, would yield a plain reference. We can write this version of our function using a const_cast: 
string &shorterString(string &s1, string &s2) 
{ 
auto &r = shorterString(const_cast<const string&>(s1), const_cast<const string&>(s2)); return const_cast<string&>(r); } 
This version calls the const version of shorterString by casting its arguments to references to const. That function returns a reference to a const string, which we know is bound to one of our original, nonconst arguments. Therefore, we know it is safe to cast that string back to a plain string& in the return. 
Calling an Overloaded Function 
Once we have defined a set of overloaded functions, we need to be 
able 
to 
call 
them 
with 
appropriate 
arguments. 
Function 
matching 
(also 
known 
as 
overload 
resolution) 
is 
the 
process by which a particular function call is associated with a specific function from a set of overloaded functions. The compiler determines which function to call by comparing the arguments in the call with the parameters offered by each function in the overload set. 
In many'probably most'cases, it is straightforward for a programmer to determine whether a particular call is legal and, if so, which function will be called. Often the functions in the overload set differ in terms of the number of arguments, or the types of the arguments are unrelated. In such cases, it is easy to determine which function is called. Determining which function is called when the overloaded functions have the same number of parameters and those parameters are related by conversions (¬ß 4.11, p. 159) can be less obvious. We'll look at how the compiler resolves calls involving conversions in ¬ß 6.6 
(p. 242). 
For now, what's important to realize is that for any given call to an overloaded function, there are three possible outcomes: 
. 
The 
compiler 
finds 
exactly 
one 
function 
that 
is 
a 
best 
match 
for 
the 
actual 
arguments 
and 
generates 
code 
to 
call 
that 
function. 

. 
There is no function with parameters that match the arguments in the call, in which case the compiler issues an error message that there was no 
match. 

. 
There is more than one function that matches and none of the matches is clearly best. This case is also an error; it is an ambiguous 
call. 


Exercises Section 6.4 Exercise 6.39: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal. 
(a) 
int calc(int, int); int calc(const int, const int); 

(b) 
int get(); double get(); 

(c) 
int *reset(int *); double *reset(double *); 


6.4.1. Overloading and Scope 

Warning 
Ordinarily, it is a bad idea to declare a function locally. However, to explain how scope interacts with overloading, we will violate this practice and use local function declarations. 
Programmers new to C++ are often confused about the interaction between scope and overloading. However, overloading has no special properties with respect to scope: As usual, if we declare a name in an inner scope, that name hides uses of that name declared in an outer scope. Names do not overload across scopes: 
string read(); 
void print(const string &); 
void print(double); // overloads the print function 
void fooBar(int ival) 
{ 
bool read = false; // new scope: hides the outer declaration of 
read 
string s = read(); // error: read is a bool variable, not a function 
// bad practice: usually it's a bad idea to declare functions at local 
scope 
void print(int); // new scope: hides previous instances of print 
print("Value: "); // error: print(const string &) is hidden 
print(ival); // ok: print(int) is visible 
print(3.14); // ok: calls print(int); print(double) is hidden 
} 
Most readers will not be surprised that the call to read is in error. When the compiler processes the call to read, it finds the local definition of read. That name is a bool variable, and we cannot call a bool. Hence, the call is illegal. 
Exactly the same process is used to resolve the calls to print. The declaration of print(int) in fooBar hides the earlier declarations of print. It is as if there is only one print function available: the one that takes a single int parameter. 
When we call print, the compiler first looks for a declaration of that name. It finds the local declaration for print that takes an int. Once a name is found, the compiler ignores uses of that name in any outer scope. Instead, the compiler assumes that the declaration it found is the one for the name we are using. What remains is to see if the use of the name is valid. 

Note 
In C++, name lookup happens before type checking. 
The first call passes a string literal, but the only declaration for print that is in scope has a parameter that is an int. A string literal cannot be converted to an int, so this call is an error. The print(const string&) function, which would have matched this call, is hidden and is not considered. 
When we call print passing a double, the process is repeated. The compiler finds the local definition of print(int). The double argument can be converted to an int, so the call is legal. 
Had we declared print(int) in the same scope as the other print functions, then it would be another overloaded version of print. In that case, these calls would be resolved differently, because the compiler will see all three functions: 
void print(const string &); 
void print(double); // overloads the print function 
void print(int); // another overloaded instance 
void fooBar2(int ival) 
{  
print("Value: "); // calls print(const string &)  
print(ival);  // calls print(int)  
print(3.14);  // calls print(double)  
}  

6.5. Features for Specialized Uses 
In this section we'll cover three function-related features that are useful in many, but not all, programs: default arguments, inline and constexpr functions, and some facilities that are often used during debugging. 
6.5.1. Default Arguments 
Some functions have parameters that are given a particular value in most, but not all, calls. In such cases, we can declare that common value as a default 
argument 
for the function. Functions with default arguments can be called with or without that argument. 
For example, we might use a string to represent the contents of a window. By default, we might want the window to have a particular height, width, and background character. However, we might also want to allow users to pass values other than the defaults. To accommodate both default and specified values we would declare our function to define the window as follows: 
typedef string::size_type sz; // typedef see ¬ß 2.5.1 (p. 67)string 
screen(sz ht = 24, sz wid = 80, char backgrnd = ' '); Here we've provided a default for each parameter. A default argument is specified as an initializer for a parameter in the parameter list. We may define defaults for one or more parameters. However, if a parameter has a default argument, all the parameters that follow it must also have default arguments. 
Calling Functions with Default Arguments 
If we want to use the default argument, we omit that argument when we call the function. Because screen provides defaults for all of its parameters, we can call screen with zero, one, two, or three arguments: 
string window; 
window = screen(); // equivalent to screen(24,80,' ') 
window = screen(66);// equivalent to screen(66,80,' ') 
window = screen(66, 256); // screen(66,256,' ') 
window = screen(66, 256, '#'); // screen(66,256,'#') 
Arguments in the call are resolved by position. The default arguments are used for the trailing (right-most) arguments of a call. For example, to override the default for background, we must also supply arguments for height and width: 
window = screen(, , '?'); // error: can omit only trailing arguments 
window = screen('?'); // calls screen('?',80,' ') 
Note that the second call, which passes a single character value, is legal. Although legal, it is unlikely to be what was intended. The call is legal because '?' is a char, and a char can be converted (¬ß 4.11.1, p. 160) to the type of the left-most parameter. That parameter is string::size_type, which is an unsigned integral type. In this call, the char argument is implicitly converted to string::size_type, and is passed as the argument to height. On our machine, '?' has the hexadecimal value 0x3F, which is decimal 63. Thus, this call passes 63 to the height parameter. 
Part of the work of designing a function with default arguments is ordering the parameters so that those least likely to use a default value appear first and those most likely to use a default appear last. 
Default Argument Declarations 
Although it is normal practice to declare a function once inside a header, it is legal to redeclare a function multiple times. However, each parameter can have its default specified only once in a given scope. Thus, any subsequent declaration can add a default only for a parameter that has not previously had a default specified. As usual, defaults can be specified only if all parameters to the right already have defaults. For example, given 
// no default for the height or width parameters string screen(sz, sz, char = ' '); 
we cannot change an already declared default value: 
string screen(sz, sz, char = '*'); // error: redeclaration 
but we can add a default argument as follows: 
string screen(sz = 24, sz = 80, char); // ok: adds default arguments 

Best Practices 
Default arguments ordinarily should be specified with the function declaration in an appropriate header. 
Default Argument Initializers 
Local variables may not be used as a default argument. Excepting that restriction, a default argument can be any expression that has a type that is convertible to the type of the parameter: 
// the declarations of wd, def, and ht must appear outside a function 
sz wd =80; 
char def = ''; 
sz ht(); 
string screen(sz = ht(), sz = wd, char = def); 
string window = screen(); // calls screen(ht(), 80, ' ') 
Names used as default arguments are resolved in the scope of the function declaration. The value that those names represent is evaluated at the time of the call: 
void f2() { def = '*'; // changes the value of a default argument sz wd = 100; // hides the outer definition of wd but does not change the default window = screen(); // calls screen(ht(), 80, '*') } 
Inside f2, we changed the value of def. The call to screen passes this updated value. Our function also declared a local variable that hides the outer wd. However, the local named wd is unrelated to the default argument passed to screen. 
Exercises Section 6.5.1 Exercise 6.40: Which, if either, of the following declarations are errors? Why? 
(a) 
int ff(int a, int b = 0, int c = 0); 

(b) 
char *init(int ht = 24, int wd, char bckgrnd); 


Exercise 6.41: Which, if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why? Which, if any, are legal but unlikely to match the programmer's intent? Why? 
char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' '); 
(a) init(); 
(b) init(24,10); 
(c) init(14, '*'); 
Exercise 6.42: Give the second parameter of make_plural (¬ß 6.3.2, p. 224) a default argument of 's'. Test your program by printing singular and plural versions of the words success and failure. 
6.5.2. Inline and constexpr Functions 
In ¬ß 6.3.2 
(p. 224) we wrote a small function that returned a reference to the shorter of its two string parameters. The benefits of defining a function for such a small operation include the following: 
. 
It is easier to read and understand a call to shorterString than it would be to read and understand the equivalent conditional expression. 

. 
Using a function ensures uniform behavior. Each test is guaranteed to be done the same way. 

. 
If we need to change the computation, it is easier to change the function than to find and change every occurrence of the equivalent expression. 

. 
The function can be reused rather than rewritten for other applications. 


There is, however, one potential drawback to making shorterString a function: Calling a function is apt to be slower than evaluating the equivalent expression. On most machines, a function call does a lot of work: Registers are saved before the call and restored after the return; arguments may be copied; and the program branches to a new location. 
inline Functions Avoid Function Call Overhead 
A function specified as inline 
(usually) is expanded 'in line' at each call. If shorterString were defined as inline, then this call 
cout << shorterString(s1, s2) << endl; 
(probably) would be expanded during compilation into something like 
cout << (s1.size() < s2.size() ? s1 : s2) << endl; 
The run-time overhead of making shorterString a function is thus removed. 
We can define shorterString as an inline function by putting the keyword inline before the function's return type: 
// inline version: find the shorter of two strings 
inline const string & shorterString(const string &s1, const string &s2) { 
return s1.size() <= s2.size() ? s1 : s2; } 

Note 
The inline specification is only a request to the compiler. The compiler may choose to ignore this request. 
In general, the inline mechanism is meant to optimize small, straight-line functions that are called frequently. Many compilers will not inline a recursive function. A 75-line function will almost surely not be expanded inline. 

constexpr Functions 

A constexpr 
function is a function that can be used in a constant expression (¬ß 2.4.4, p. 65). A constexpr function is defined like any other function but must meet certain restrictions: The return type and the type of each parameter in a must be a literal type (¬ß 2.4.4, p. 66), and the function body must contain exactly one return statement: 
constexpr int new_sz() { return 42; } 
constexpr int foo = new_sz(); // ok: foo is a constant expression 
Here we defined new_sz as a constexpr that takes no arguments. The compiler can verify'at compile time'that a call to new_sz returns a constant expression, so we can use new_sz to initialize our constexpr variable, foo. 
When it can do so, the compiler will replace a call to a constexpr function with its resulting value. In order to be able to expand the function immediately, constexpr functions are implicitly inline. 
A constexpr function body may contain other statements so long as those statements generate no actions at run time. For example, a constexpr function may contain null statements, type aliases (¬ß 2.5.1, p. 67), and using declarations. 
A constexpr function is permitted to return a value that is not a constant: 
// scale(arg) is a constant expression if arg is a constant expression constexpr size_t scale(size_t cnt) { return new_sz() * cnt; } 
The scale function will return a constant expression if its argument is a constant expression but not otherwise: 
int arr[scale(2)]; // ok: scale(2) is a constant expression 
int i=2; // i is not a constant expression 
int a2[scale(i)]; // error: scale(i) is not a constant expression 
When we pass a constant expression'such as the literal 2' then the return is a constant expression. In this case, the compiler will replace the call to scale with the resulting value. 
If we call scale with an expression that is not a constant expression'such as on the int object i'then the return is not a constant expression. If we use scale in a context that requires a constant expression, the compiler checks that the result is a constant expression. If it is not, the compiler will produce an error message. 

Note 
A constexpr function is not required to return a constant expression. 
Put inline and constexpr Functions in Header Files 
Unlike other functions, inline and constexpr functions may be defined multiple times in the program. After all, the compiler needs the definition, not just the declaration, in order to expand the code. However, all of the definitions of a given inline or constexpr must match exactly. As a result, inline and constexpr functions normally are defined in headers. 
Exercises Section 6.5.2 Exercise 6.43: Which one of the following declarations and definitions would you put in a header? In a source 
file? Explain why.

6.5.3. Aids for Debugging 
C++ programmers sometimes use a technique similar to header guards (¬ß 2.6.3, p. 77) to conditionally execute debugging code. The idea is that the program will contain debugging code that is executed only while the program is being developed. When the application is completed and ready to ship, the debugging code is turned off. This approach uses two preprocessor facilities: assert and NDEBUG. 
The assert Preprocessor Macro 
assert 
is a preprocessor 
macro. A preprocessor macro is a preprocessor variable that acts somewhat like an inline function. The assert macro takes a single expression, which it uses as a condition: 
assert(expr); 
evaluates expr and if the expression is false (i.e., zero), then assert writes a message and terminates the program. If the expression is true (i.e., is nonzero), then assert does nothing. 
The assert macro is defined in the cassert header. As we've seen, preprocessor names are managed by the preprocessor not the compiler (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 54). As a result, we use preprocessor names directly and do not provide a using declaration for them. That is, we refer to assert, not std::assert, and provide no using declaration for assert. 
As with preprocessor variables, macro names must be unique within the program. Programs that include the cassert header may not define a variable, function, or other entity named assert. In practice, it is a good idea to avoid using the name assert for our own purposes even if we don't include cassert. Many headers include the cassert header, which means that even if you don't directly include that file, your programs are likely to have it included anyway. 
The assert macro is often used to check for conditions that 'cannot happen.¬ß For example, a program that does some manipulation of input text might know that all words it is given are always longer than a threshold. That program might contain a statement such as 
assert(word.size() > threshold); 
The NDEBUG Preprocessor Variable 
The behavior of assert depends on the status of a preprocessor variable named NDEBUG. If NDEBUG is defined, assert does nothing. By default, NDEBUG is not defined, so, by default, assert performs a run-time check. 
We can 'turn off' debugging by providing a #define to define NDEBUG. Alternatively, most compilers provide a command-line option that lets us define preprocessor variables: 
$ CC -D NDEBUG main.C # use /D with the Microsoft compiler 
has the same effect as writing #define NDEBUG at the beginning of main.C. 
If NDEBUG is defined, we avoid the potential run-time overhead involved in checking various conditions. Of course, there is also no run-time check. Therefore, assert should be used only to verify things that truly should not be possible. It can be useful as an aid in getting a program debugged but should not be used to substitute for run-time logic checks or error checking that the program should do. 
In addition to using assert, we can write our own conditional debugging code using NDEBUG. If NDEBUG is not defined, the code between the #ifndef and the #endif is executed. If NDEBUG is defined, that code is ignored: 
void print(const int ia[], size_t size) 
{ 
#ifndef NDEBUG 
// _ _func_ _ is a local static defined by the compiler that holds the function's name 
cerr << _ _func_ _ << ": array size is " << size << endl; #endif // ... 
Here we use a variable named _ _func_ _ to print the name of the function we are debugging. The compiler defines _ _func_ _ in every function. It is a local static array of const char that holds the name of the function. 
In addition to _ _func_ _, which the C++ compiler defines, the preprocessor defines four other names that can be useful in debugging: 
_ _FILE_ _ string literal containing the name of the file _ _LINE_ _ integer literal containing the current line number _ _TIME_ _ string literal containing the time the file was 
compiled _ _DATE_ _ string literal containing the date the file was compiled We might use these constants to report additional information in error messages: 
if (word.size() < threshold) 
cerr << "Error: " << _ _FILE_ _ << " : in function " << _ _func_ _ << " at line " << _ _LINE_ _<< endl << " Compiled on " << _ _DATE_ _ << " at " << _ _TIME_ _ << endl << " Word read was \"" << word << "\": Length too short" << endl; 
If we give this program a string that is shorter than the threshold, then the following error message will be generated: 
Error: wdebug.cc : in function main at line 27 Compiled on Jul 11 2012 at 20:50:03 Word read was "foo": Length too short 
6.6. Function Matching 

In many (if not most) cases, it is easy to figure out which overloaded function matches a given call. However, it is not so simple when the overloaded functions have the same number of parameters and when one or more of the parameters have types that are related by conversions. As an example, consider the following set of functions and function call: 
void f(); 
void f(int); 
void f(int, int); 
void f(double, double = 3.14); 
f(5.6); // calls void f(double, double) 
Exercises Section 6.5.3 
Exercise 6.47: Revise the program you wrote in the exercises in ¬ß 6.3.2 
(p. 228) that used recursion to print the contents of a vector to conditionally print information about its execution. For example, you might print the size of the vector on each call. Compile and run the program with debugging turned on and again with it turned off. 
Exercise 6.48: Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of assert: 
string s; while (cin >> s && s != sought) { } // empty body assert(cin); 
Determining the Candidate and Viable Functions 
The first step of function matching identifies the set of 
overloaded functions considered for the call. The functions in this set are the candidate 
functions. A candidate function is a function with the same name as the called function and for which a declaration is visible at the point of the call. In this example, there are four candidate functions named f. 
The second step selects from the set of candidate functions those functions that can be called with the arguments in the given call. The selected functions are the viable 
functions. To be viable, a function must have the same number of parameters as there are arguments in the call, and the type of each argument must match'or be convertible to'the type of its corresponding parameter. 
We can eliminate two of our candidate functions based on the number of arguments. The function that has no parameters and the one that has two int parameters are not viable for this call. Our call has only one argument, and these functions have zero and two parameters, respectively. 
The function that takes a single int and the function that takes two doubles might be viable. Either of these functions can be called with a single argument. The function taking two doubles has a default argument, which means it can be called with a single argument. 

Note 
When a function has default arguments (¬ß 6.5.1, p. 236), a call may appear to have fewer arguments than it actually does. 
Having used the number of arguments to winnow the candidate functions, we next look at whether the argument types match those of the parameters. As with any call, an argument might match its parameter either because the types match exactly or because there is a conversion from the argument type to the type of the parameter. In this example, both of our remaining functions are viable: 
. 
f(int) is viable because a conversion exists that can convert the argument of type double to the parameter of type int. 

. 
f(double, double) is viable because a default argument is provided for the function's second parameter and its first parameter is of type double, which exactly matches the type of the parameter. 



Note 
If there are no viable functions, the compiler will complain that there is no matching function. 
Finding the Best Match, If Any 
The third step of function matching determines which viable function provides the best match for the call. This process looks at each argument in the call and selects the viable function (or functions) for which the corresponding parameter best matches the argument. We'll explain the details of 'best' in the next section, but the idea is that the closer the types of the argument and parameter are to each other, the better the match. 
In our case, there is only one (explicit) argument in the call. That argument has type double. To call f(int), the argument would have to be converted from double to int. The other viable function, f(double, double), is an exact match for this argument. An exact match is better than a match that requires a conversion. Therefore, the compiler will resolve the call f(5.6) as a call to the function that has two double parameters. The compiler will add the default argument for the second, missing argument. 
Function Matching with Multiple Parameters 
Function matching is more complicated if there are two or more arguments. Given the same functions named f, let's analyze the following call: 
f(42, 2.56); 
The set of viable functions is selected in the same way as when there is only one parameter. The compiler selects those functions that have the required number of parameters and for which the argument types match the parameter types. In this case, the viable functions are f(int, int) and f(double, double). The compiler then determines, argument by argument, which function is (or functions are) the best match. There is an overall best match if there is one and only one function for which 
. 
The match for each argument is no worse than the match required by any other viable function 

. 
There is at least one argument for which the match is better than the match provided by any other viable function 


If after looking at each argument there is no single function that is preferable, then the call is in error. The compiler will complain that the call is ambiguous. 
In this call, when we look only at the first argument, we find that the function f(int, int) is an exact match. To match the second function, the int argument 42 must be converted to double. A match through a built-in conversion is 'less good' than one that is exact. Considering only the first argument, f(int, int) is a better match than f(double, double). 
When we look at the second argument, f(double, double) is an exact match to the argument 2.56. Calling f(int, int) would require that 2.56 be converted from double to int. When we consider only the second parameter, the function f(double, double) is a better match. 
The compiler will reject this call because it is ambiguous: Each viable function is a better match than the other on one of the arguments to the call. It might be tempting to force a match by explicitly casting (¬ß 4.11.3, p. 162) one of our arguments. However, in well-designed systems, argument casts should not be necessary. 

Best Practices 
Casts should not be needed to call an overloaded function. The need for a cast suggests that the parameter sets are designed poorly. 
Exercises Section 6.6 
Exercise 6.49: What is a candidate function? What is a viable function? Exercise 6.50: Given the declarations for f from page 
242, list the viable functions, if any for each of the following calls. Indicate which function is the best match, or if the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the call is ambiguous. 
(a) f(2.56, 42) 
(b) f(42) 
(c) f(42, 0) 
(d) f(2.56, 3.14) 
Exercise 6.51: Write all four versions of f. Each function should print a distinguishing message. Check your answers for the previous exercise. If your answers were incorrect, study this section until you understand why your answers were wrong. 
6.6.1. Argument Type Conversions 

In order to determine the best match, the compiler ranks the conversions that could be used to convert each argument to the type of its corresponding parameter. Conversions are ranked as follows: 
1. An exact match. An exact match happens when: 
. 
The argument and parameter types are identical. 

. 
The argument is converted from an array or function type to the corresponding pointer type. (¬ß 6.7 
(p. 247) covers function pointers.) 

. 
A top-level const is added to or discarded from the argument. 


2. 
Match through a const conversion (¬ß 4.11.2, p. 162). 

3. 
Match through a promotion (¬ß 4.11.1, p. 160). 

4. 
Match through an arithmetic (¬ß 4.11.1, p. 159) or pointer conversion (¬ß 4.11.2, p. 161). 

5. 
Match through a class-type conversion. (¬ß 14.9 
(p. 579) covers these conversions.) 


Matches Requiring Promotion or Arithmetic Conversion 

Warning 
Promotions and conversions among the built-in types can yield surprising results in the context of function matching. Fortunately, well-designed systems rarely include functions with parameters as closely related as those in the following examples. 
In order to analyze a call, it is important to remember that the small integral types always promote to int or to a larger integral type. Given two functions, one of which takes an int and the other a short, the short version will be called only on values of type short. Even though the smaller integral values might appear to be a closer match, those values are promoted to int, whereas calling the short version would require a conversion: 
void ff(int); 
void ff(short); 
ff('a'); // char promotes to int; calls f(int) 
All the arithmetic conversions are treated as equivalent to each other. The conversion from int to unsigned int, for example, does not take precedence over the conversion from int to double. As a concrete example, consider 
void manip(long); 
void manip(float); 
manip(3.14); // error: ambiguous call 
The literal 3.14 is a double. That type can be converted to either long or float. Because there are two possible arithmetic conversions, the call is ambiguous. 
Function Matching and const Arguments 
When we call an overloaded function that differs on whether a reference or pointer parameter refers or points to const, the compiler uses the constness of the argument to decide which function to call: 
Record lookup(Account&); // function that takes a reference to Account Record lookup(const Account&); // new function that takes a const reference 
const Account a; 
Account b; 
lookup(a); // calls lookup(const Account&) 
lookup(b); // calls lookup(Account&) 
In the first call, we pass the const object a. We cannot bind a plain reference to a const object. In this case the only viable function is the version that takes a reference to const. Moreover, that call is an exact match to the argument a. 
In the second call, we pass the nonconst object b. For this call, both functions are viable. We can use b to initialize a reference to either const or nonconst type. However, initializing a reference to const from a nonconst object requires a conversion. The version that takes a nonconst parameter is an exact match for b. Hence, the nonconst version is preferred. 
Pointer parameters work in a similar way. If two functions differ only as to whether a pointer parameter points to const or nonconst, the compiler can distinguish which function to call based on the constness of the argument: If the argument is a pointer to const, the call will match the function that takes a const*; otherwise, if the argument is a pointer to nonconst, the function taking a plain pointer is called. 
Exercises Section 6.6.1 Exercise 6.52: Given the following declarations, 
void manip(int, int); double dobj; 
what is the rank (¬ß 6.6.1, p. 245) of each conversion in the following calls? 
(a) manip('a', 'z'); 
(b) manip(55.4, dobj); 
Exercise 6.53: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal. 
(a) 
int calc(int&, int&); int calc(const int&, const int&); 

(b) 
int calc(char*, char*); int calc(const char*, const char*); 

(c) 
int calc(char*, char*); int calc(char* const, char* const); 


6.7. Pointers to Functions 
A function pointer is just that'a pointer that denotes a function rather than an object. Like any other pointer, a function pointer points to a particular type. A function's type is determined by its return type and the types of its parameters. The function's name is not part of its type. For example: 
// compares lengths of two stringsbool lengthCompare(const string &, const string &); 
has type bool(const string&, const string&). To declare a pointer that can point at this function, we declare a pointer in place of the function name: 
// pf points to a function returning bool that takes two const string references bool (*pf)(const string &, const string &); // uninitialized 
Starting from the name we are declaring, we see that pf is preceded by a *, so pf is a pointer. To the right is a parameter list, which means that pf points to a function. Looking left, we find that the type the function returns is bool. Thus, pf points to a function that has two const string& parameters and returns bool. 

Note 
The parentheses around *pf are necessary. If we omit the parentheses, then we declare pf as a function that returns a pointer to bool: 
// declares a function named pf that returns a bool* 
bool *pf(const string &, const string &); 
Using Function Pointers 
When we use the name of a function as a value, the function is automatically converted to a pointer. For example, we can assign the address of lengthCompare to pf as follows: 
pf = lengthCompare; // pf now points to the function named lengthCompare pf = &lengthCompare; // equivalent assignment: address-of operator is optional 
Moreover, we can use a pointer to a function to call the function to which the pointer points. We can do so directly' there is no need to dereference the pointer: 
bool b1 = pf("hello", "goodbye"); // calls lengthCompare bool b2 = (*pf)("hello", "goodbye"); // equivalent call bool b3 = lengthCompare("hello", "goodbye"); // equivalent call 
There is no conversion between pointers to one function type and pointers to another function type. However, as usual, we can assign nullptr (¬ß 2.3.2, p. 53) or a zero-valued integer constant expression to a function pointer to indicate that the pointer does not point to any function: 
string::size_type sumLength(const string&, const string&); bool cstringCompare(const char*, const char*); pf =0; // ok: pf points to no function pf = sumLength; // error: return type differs pf = cstringCompare; // error: parameter types differ pf = lengthCompare; // ok: function and pointer types match exactly 
Pointers to Overloaded Functions 
As usual, when we use an overloaded function, the context must make it clear which version is being used. When we 
declare a pointer to an overloaded function 
void ff(int*); 
void ff(unsigned int); 
void (*pf1)(unsigned int) = ff; // pf1 points to ff(unsigned) 
the compiler uses the type of the pointer to determine which overloaded function to use. The type of the pointer must match one of the overloaded functions exactly: 
void (*pf2)(int) = ff; // error: no ff with a matching parameter list double (*pf3)(int*) = ff; // error: return type of ff and pf3 don't match 
Function Pointer Parameters 
Just as with arrays (¬ß 6.2.4, p. 214), we cannot define parameters of function type but can have a parameter that is a pointer to function. As with arrays, we can write a parameter that looks like a function type, but it will be treated as a pointer: 
// third parameter is a function type and is automatically treated as a pointer to function 
void useBigger(const string &s1, const string &s2, 
bool pf(const string &, const string &)); // equivalent declaration: explicitly define the parameter as a pointer to function 
void useBigger(const string &s1, const string &s2, bool (*pf)(const string &, const string &)); 
When we pass a function as an argument, we can do so directly. It will be automatically converted to a pointer: 
// automatically converts the function lengthCompare to a pointer to function 
useBigger(s1, s2, lengthCompare); 
As we've just seen in the declaration of useBigger, writing function pointer types quickly gets tedious. Type aliases (¬ß 2.5.1, p. 67), along with decltype (¬ß 2.5.3, p. 70), let us simplify code that uses function pointers: 
// Func and Func2 have function type 
typedef bool Func(const string&, const string&); 
typedef decltype(lengthCompare) Func2; // equivalent type 
// FuncP and FuncP2 have pointer to function type 
typedef bool(*FuncP)(const string&, const string&); 
typedef decltype(lengthCompare) *FuncP2; // equivalent type 
Here we've used typedef to define our types. Both Func and Func2 are function types, whereas FuncP and FuncP2 are pointer types. It is important to note that decltype returns the function type; the automatic conversion to pointer is not done. Because decltype returns a function type, if we want a pointer we must add the * ourselves. We can redeclare useBigger using any of these types: 
// equivalent declarations of useBigger using type aliases 
void useBigger(const string&, const string&, Func); 
void useBigger(const string&, const string&, FuncP2); Both declarations declare the same function. In the first case, the compiler will automatically convert the function type represented by Func to a pointer. 
Returning a Pointer to Function 
As with arrays (¬ß 6.3.3, p. 228), we can't return a function type but can return a pointer to a function type. Similarly, we must write the return type as a pointer type; the compiler will not automatically treat a function return type as the corresponding pointer type. Also as with array returns, by far the easiest way to declare a function that returns a pointer to function is by using a type alias: 
using F = int(int*, int); // F is a function type, not a pointer 
using PF = int(*)(int*, int); // PF is a pointer type 
Here we used type alias declarations (¬ß 2.5.1, p. 68) to define F as a function type and PF as a pointer to function type. The thing to keep in mind is that, unlike what happens to parameters that have function type, the return type is not automatically converted to a pointer type. We must explicitly specify that the return type is a pointer type: 
PF f1(int); // ok: PF is a pointer to function; f1 returns a pointer to function F f1(int); // error: F is a function type; f1 can't return a function F *f1(int); // ok: explicitly specify that the return type is a pointer to function 
Of course, we can also declare f1 directly, which we'd do as 
int (*f1(int))(int*, int); 
Reading this declaration from the inside out, we see that f1 has a parameter list, so f1 is a function. f1 is preceded by a * so f1 returns a pointer. The type of that pointer itself has a parameter list, so the pointer points to a function. That function returns an int. 
For completeness, it's worth noting that we can simplify declarations of functions that return pointers to function by using a trailing return (¬ß 6.3.3, p. 229): 
auto f1(int) -> int (*)(int*, int); 
Using auto or decltype for Function Pointer Types 
If we know which function(s) we want to return, we can use decltype to simplify writing a function pointer return type. For example, assume we have two functions, both of which return a string::size_type and have two const string& parameters. We can write a third function that takes a string parameter and returns a pointer to one of these two functions as follows: 
string::size_type sumLength(const string&, const string&); string::size_type largerLength(const string&, const string&); 
// depending on the value of its string parameter, 
// getFcn returns a pointer to sumLength or to largerLength 
decltype(sumLength) *getFcn(const string &); 
The only tricky part in declaring getFcn is to remember that when we apply decltype to a function, it returns a function type, not a pointer to function type. We must add a * to indicate that we are returning a pointer, not a function. 
Exercises Section 6.7 Exercise 6.54: Write a declaration for a function that takes two int parameters and returns an int, and 
declare a vector whose elements have this function pointer type. Exercise 6.55: Write four functions that add, subtract, 
multiply, and divide two int values. Store pointers to 
these values in your vector from the previous exercise. Exercise 6.56: Call each element in the vector and print their result. 
Chapter Summary 
Functions are named units of computation and are essential to structuring even modest programs. Every function has a return type, a name, a (possibly empty) list of parameters, and a function body. The function body is a block that is executed when the function is called. When a function is called, the arguments passed to the function must be compatible with the types of the corresponding parameters. 
In C++, functions may be overloaded: The same name may be used to define different functions as long as the number or types of the parameters in the functions differ. The compiler automatically figures out which function to call based on the arguments in a call. The process of selecting the right function from a set of overloaded functions is referred to as function matching.

our 
own 
operators. 

The fundamental ideas behind classes 
are data 
abstraction 
and encapsulation. Data abstraction is a programming (and design) technique that relies on the separation of interface 
and implementation. The interface of a class consists of the operations that users of the class can execute. The implementation includes the class' data members, the bodies of the functions that constitute the interface, and any functions needed to define the class that are not intended for general use. 
Encapsulation enforces the separation of a class' interface and implementation. A class that is encapsulated hides its implementation'users of the class can use the interface but have no access to the implementation. 
A class that uses data abstraction and encapsulation defines an abstract 
data 
type. In an abstract data type, the class designer worries about how the class is implemented. Programmers who use the class need not know how the type works. They can instead think abstractly about what the type does. 
7.1. Defining Abstract Data Types 
The Sales_item class that we used in Chapter 
1 
is an abstract data type. We use a Sales_item object by using its interface (i.e., the operations described in ¬ß 1.5.1 
(p. 20)). We have no access to the data members stored in a Sales_item object. Indeed, we don't even know what data members that class has. 
Our Sales_data class (¬ß 2.6.1, p. 72) is not an abstract data type. It lets users of the class access its data members and forces users to write their own operations. To make Sales_data an abstract type, we need to define operations for users of Sales_data to use. Once Sales_data defines its own operations, we can encapsulate (that is, hide) its data members. 
7.1.1. Designing the Sales_data Class 

Ultimately, we want Sales_data to support the same set of operations as the Sales_item class. The Sales_item class had one member 
function 
(¬ß 1.5.2, p. 23), named isbn, and supported the +, =, +=, <<, and >> operators. 
We'll learn how to define our own operators in Chapter 
14. For now, we'll define ordinary (named) functions for these operations. For reasons that we will explain in ¬ß 14.1 
(p. 555), the functions that do addition and IO will not be members of Sales_data. Instead, we'll define those functions as ordinary functions. The function that handles compound assignment will be a member, and for reasons we'll explain in ¬ß 7.1.5 
(p. 267), our class doesn't need to define assignment. 
Thus, the interface to Sales_data consists of the following operations: 
. 
An isbn member function to return the object's ISBN 

.A 
combine member function to add one Sales_data object 

into another 

. 
A function named add to add two Sales_data objects 

.A 
read function to read data from an istream into a Sales_data object 

.A 
print function to print the value of a Sales_data object on an ostream 


Key Concept: Different Kinds of Programming Roles Programmers tend to think about the people who will run their applications as users. Similarly a class designer designs and implements a class for users of that class. In this case, the user is a programmer, not the ultimate user of the application. 
When we refer to a user, the context makes it clear which kind of user is meant. If we speak of user code or the user of the Sales_data class, we mean a programmer who is using a class. If we speak of the user of the bookstore application, we mean the manager of the store who is running the application. 

Note 
C++ programmers tend to speak of users interchangeably as users of the application or users of a class. 
In simple applications, the user of a class and the designer of the class might be one and the same person. Even in such cases, it is useful to keep the roles distinct. When we design the interface of a class, we should think about how easy it will be to use the class. When we use the class, we shouldn't think about how the class works. 
Authors of successful applications do a good job of understanding and implementing the needs of the application's users. Similarly, good class designers pay close attention to the needs of the programmers who will use the class. A well-designed class has an interface that is intuitive and easy to use and has an implementation that is efficient enough for its intended use. 
Using the Revised Sales_data Class 
Before we think about how to implement our class, let's look at how we can use our interface functions. As one example, we can use these functions to write a version of the bookstore program from ¬ß 1.6 
(p. 24) that works with Sales_data objects rather than Sales_items: 
Sales_data total; // variable to hold the running sum 
if (read(cin, total)) { // read the first transaction 
Sales_data trans; // variable to hold data for the next 
transaction 
while(read(cin, trans)) { // read the remaining 
transactions if (total.isbn() == trans.isbn()) // check the isbns total.combine(trans); // update the running total 
else { 
print(cout, total) << endl; // print the results 
total = trans; // process the next book 
} 
} 
print(cout, total) << endl; // print the last transaction 
} else { // there was no input 
cerr << "No data?!" << endl; // notify the user 
} 
We start by defining a Sales_data object to hold the running total. Inside the if condition, we call read to read the first transaction into total. This condition works like other loops we've written that used the >> operator. Like the >> operator, our read function will return its stream parameter, which the condition checks (¬ß 4.11.2, p. 162). If the read fails, we fall through to the else to print an error message. 
If there are data to read, we define trans, which we'll use to hold each transaction. The condition in the while also checks the stream returned by read. So long as the input operations in read succeed, the condition succeeds and we have another transaction to process. 
Inside the while, we call the isbn members of total and trans to fetch their respective ISBNs. If total and trans refer to the same book, we call combine to add the components of trans into the running total in total. If trans represents a new book, we call print to print the total for the previous book. Because print returns a reference to its stream parameter, we can use the result of print as the left-hand operand of the <<. We do so to print a newline following the output generated by print. We next assign trans to total, thus setting up to process the records for the next book in the file. 
After we have exhausted the input, we have to remember to print the data for the last transaction, which we do in the call to print following the while loop. 
Exercises Section 7.1.1 Exercise 7.1: Write a version of the transaction-processing program from ¬ß 1.6 
(p. 24) using the Sales_data class you defined for the exercises in ¬ß 2.6.1 
(p. 72). 
7.1.2. Defining the Revised Sales_data Class 

Our revised class will have the same data members as the version we defined in ¬ß 2.6.1 
(p. 72): bookNo,a string representing the ISBN; units_sold, an unsigned that says how many copies of the book were sold; and revenue,a double representing the total revenue for those sales. 
As we've seen, our class will also have two member functions, combine and isbn. In addition, we'll give Sales_data another member function to return the average price at which the books were sold. This function, which we'll name avg_price, isn't intended for general use. It will be part of the implementation, not part of the interface. 
We define (¬ß 6.1, p. 202) and declare (¬ß 6.1.2, p. 206) member functions similarly to ordinary functions. Member functions must be declared inside the class. Member functions may be defined inside the class itself or outside the class body. Nonmember functions that are part of the interface, such as add, read, and print, are declared and defined outside the class. 
With this knowledge, we're ready to write our revised version of Sales_data: 
struct Sales_data { // new members: operations on Sales_data objects 
std::string isbn() const { return bookNo; } 
Sales_data& combine(const Sales_data&); 
double avg_price() const; 
// data members are unchanged from ¬ß 2.6.1 (p. 72) 
std::string bookNo; 
unsigned units_sold = 0; 
double revenue = 0.0; 
}; 
// nonmember Sales_data interface functions 
Sales_data add(const Sales_data&, const Sales_data&); 
std::ostream &print(std::ostream&, const Sales_data&); 
std::istream &read(std::istream&, Sales_data&); 


Note 
Functions defined in the class are implicitly inline (¬ß 6.5.2, p. 238). 
Defining Member Functions 
Although every member must be declared inside its class, we can define a member function's body either inside or outside of the class body. In Sales_data, isbn is defined inside the class; combine and avg_price will be defined elsewhere. 
We'll start by explaining the isbn function, which returns a string and has an empty parameter list: 
std::string isbn() const { return bookNo; } 
As with any function, the body of a member function is a block. In this case, the block contains a single return statement that returns the bookNo data member of a Sales_data object. The interesting thing about this function is how it gets the object from which to fetch the bookNo member. 
Introducing this 

Let's look again at a call to the isbn member function: 
total.isbn() Here we use the dot operator (¬ß 4.6, p. 150) to fetch the isbn member of the object named total, which we then call. 
With one exception that we'll cover in ¬ß 7.6 
(p. 300), when we call a member function we do so on behalf of an object. When isbn refers to members of Sales_data (e.g., bookNo), it is referring implicitly to the members of the object on which the function was called. In this call, when isbn returns bookNo, it is implicitly returning total.bookNo. 
Member functions access the object on which they were called through an extra, implicit parameter named this. When we call a member function, this is initialized with the address of the object on which the function was invoked. For example, when we call 
total.isbn() 
the compiler passes the address of total to the implicit this parameter in isbn. It is as if the compiler rewrites this call as 
// pseudo-code illustration of how a call to a member function is translated 
Sales_data::isbn(&total) 
which calls the isbn member of Sales_data passing the address of total. 
Inside a member function, we can refer directly to the members of the object on which the function was called. We do not have to use a member access operator to use the members of the object to which this points. Any direct use of a member of the class is assumed to be an implicit reference through this. That is, when isbn uses bookNo, it is implicitly using the member to which this points. It is as if we had written this->bookNo. 
The this parameter is defined for us implicitly. Indeed, it is illegal for us to define a parameter or variable named this. Inside the body of a member function, we can use this. It would be legal, although unnecessary, to define isbn as 
std::string isbn() const { return this->bookNo; } 
Because this is intended to always refer to 'this' object, this is a const pointer (¬ß 2.4.2, p. 62). We cannot change the address that this holds. 
Introducing const Member Functions 
The other important part about the isbn function is the keyword const that follows the parameter list. The purpose of that const is to modify the type of the implicit this pointer. 
By default, the type of this is a const pointer to the nonconst version of the class type. For example, by default, the type of this in a Sales_data member function is Sales_data *const. Although this is implicit, it follows the normal initialization rules, which means that (by default) we cannot bind this to a const object (¬ß 2.4.2, p. 62). This fact, in turn, means that we cannot call an ordinary member function on a const object. 
If isbn were an ordinary function and if this were an ordinary pointer parameter, we would declare this as const Sales_data *const. After all, the body of isbn doesn't change the object to which this points, so our function would be more flexible if this were a pointer to const (¬ß 6.2.3, p. 213). 
However, this is implicit and does not appear in the parameter list. There is no place to indicate that this should be a pointer to const. The language resolves this problem by letting us put const after the parameter list of a member function. A const following the parameter list indicates that this is a pointer to 
const. 
Member 
functions 
that 
use 
const 
in 
this 
way 
are 
const 
member 
functions. 

We can think of the body of isbn as if it were written as 
// pseudo-code illustration of how the implicit this pointer is used // this code is illegal: we may not explicitly define the this pointer ourselves // note that this is a pointer to const because isbn is a const member std::string Sales_data::isbn(const Sales_data *const this) { return this->isbn; } 
The fact that this is a pointer to const means that const member functions cannot change the object on which they are called. Thus, isbn may read but not write to the data members of the objects on which it is called. 

Note 
Objects that are const, and references or pointers to const objects, may call only const member functions. 
Class Scope and Member Functions 
Recall that a class is itself a scope (¬ß 2.6.1, p. 72). The definitions of the member functions of a class are nested inside the scope of the class itself. Hence, isbn's use of the name bookNo is resolved as the data member defined inside Sales_data. 
It is worth noting that isbn can use bookNo even though bookNo is defined after isbn. As we'll see in ¬ß 7.4.1 
(p. 283), the compiler processes classes in two steps'the member declarations are compiled first, after which the member function bodies, if any, are processed. Thus, member function bodies may use other members of their class regardless of where in the class those members appear. 
Defining a Member Function outside the Class 
As with any other function, when we define a member function outside the class body, the member's definition must match its declaration. That is, the return type, parameter list, and name must match the declaration in the class body. If the member was declared as a const member function, then the definition must also specify const after the parameter list. The name of a member defined outside the class must include the name of the class of which it is a member: 
double  Sales_data::avg_price()  const  {  
if  (units_sold)  
return  revenue/units_sold;  

else 
return 0; 
} 
The function name, Sales_data::avg_price, uses the scope operator (¬ß 1.2, p. 8) to say that we are defining the function named avg_price that is declared in the scope of the Sales_data class. Once the compiler sees the function name, the rest of the code is interpreted as being inside the scope of the class. Thus, when avg_price refers to revenue and units_sold, it is implicitly referring to the members of Sales_data. 
Defining a Function to Return 'This' Object 
The combine function is intended to act like the compound assignment operator, +=. The object on which this function is called represents the left-hand operand of the assignment. The right-hand operand is passed as an explicit argument: 
Sales_data& Sales_data::combine(const Sales_data &rhs) { units_sold += rhs.units_sold; // add the members of rhs into revenue += rhs.revenue; // the members of ''this'' object return *this; // return the object on which the function was called } 
When our transaction-processing program calls 
total.combine(trans); // update the running total 
the address of total is bound to the implicit this parameter and rhs is bound to trans. Thus, when combine executes 
units_sold += rhs.units_sold; // add the members of rhs into 
the effect is to add total.units_sold and trans.units_sold, storing the result back into total.units_sold. 
The interesting part about this function is its return type and the return statement. Ordinarily, when we define a function that operates like a built-in operator, our function should mimic the behavior of that operator. The built-in assignment operators return their left-hand operand as an lvalue (¬ß 4.4, p. 144). To return an lvalue, our combine function must return a reference (¬ß 6.3.2, p. 226). Because the left-hand operand is a Sales_data object, the return type is Sales_data&. 
As we've seen, we do not need to use the implicit this pointer to access the members of the object on which a member function is executing. However, we do need to use this to access the object as a whole: 
return *this; // return the object on which the function was called 
Here the return statement dereferences this to obtain the object on which the function is executing. That is, for the call above, we return a reference to total.

string to hold each of these elements. Subsequent exercises will incrementally add features to this class. Exercise 7.5: Provide operations in your Person class to 
return the name and address. Should these functions be const? Explain your choice. 
7.1.3. Defining Nonmember Class-Related Functions 

Class authors often define auxiliary functions, such as our add, 
read, and print functions. Although such functions define operations that are conceptually part of the interface of the class, they are not part of the class itself. 
We define nonmember functions as we would any other function. As with any other function, we normally separate the declaration of the function from its definition (¬ß 6.1.2, p. 206). Functions that are conceptually part of a class, but not defined inside the class, are typically declared (but not defined) in the same header as the class itself. That way users need to include only one file to use any part of the interface. 

Note 
Ordinarily, nonmember functions that are part of the interface of a class should be declared in the same header as the class itself. 
Defining the read and print Functions 
The read and print functions do the same job as the code in ¬ß 
2.6.2 
(p. 75) and not surprisingly, the bodies of our functions look a lot like the code presented there: 
// input transactions contain ISBN, number of copies sold, and sales price 
istream &read(istream &is, Sales_data &item) 
{ double price = 0; is >> item.bookNo >> item.units_sold >> price; item.revenue = price * item.units_sold; return is; 
} ostream &print(ostream &os, const Sales_data &item) { 
os << item.isbn() << " " << item.units_sold << " " << item.revenue << " " << item.avg_price(); 
return os; } 
The read function reads data from the given stream into the given object. The print function prints the contents of the given object on the given stream. 
However, there are two points worth noting about these functions. First, both read and write take a reference to their respective IO class types. The IO classes are types that cannot be copied, so we may only pass them by reference (¬ß 6.2.2, p. 210). Moreover, reading or writing to a stream changes that stream, so both functions take ordinary references, not references to const. 
The second thing to note is that print does not print a newline. Ordinarily, functions that do output should do minimal formatting. That way user code can decide whether the newline is needed. 
Defining the add Function 
The add function takes two Sales_data objects and returns a new Sales_data representing their sum: 
Sales_data add(const Sales_data &lhs, const Sales_data &rhs) { Sales_data sum = lhs; // copy data members from lhs into sum sum.combine(rhs); // add data members from rhs into sum return sum; } 
In the body of the function we define a new Sales_data object named sum to hold the sum of our two transactions. We initialize sum as acopy of lhs. By default, copying a class object copies that object's members. After the copy, the bookNo, units_sold, and revenue members of sum will have the same values as those in lhs. Next we call combine to add the units_sold and revenue members of rhs into sum. When we're done, we return a copy of sum.

(p. 260). 
Exercise 7.10: What does the condition in the following if statement do? if (read(read(cin, data1), data2)) 

#### 7.1.4. Constructors 

Each class defines how objects of its type can be initialized. Classes control object initialization by defining one or more special member functions known as constructors. The job of a constructor is to initialize the data members of a class object. A constructor is run whenever an object of a class type is created. 

In this section, we'll introduce the basics of how to define a constructor. Constructors are a surprisingly complex topic. Indeed, we'll have more to say about constructors in ¬ß 7.5 (p. 288), ¬ß 15.7 (p. 622), and ¬ß 18.1.3 (p. 777), and in Chapter 13. 

Constructors have the same name as the class. Unlike other functions, constructors have no return type. Like other functions, constructors have a (possibly empty) parameter list and a (possibly empty) function body. A class can have multiple constructors. Like any other overloaded function (¬ß 6.4, p. 230), the constructors must differ from each other in the number or types of their parameters. 

Unlike other member functions, constructors may not be declared as const (¬ß 7.1.2, p. 258). When we create a const object of a class type, the object does not assume its 'constness' until after the constructor completes the object's initialization. Thus, constructors can write to const objects during their construction. 

##### The Synthesized Default Constructor 

üîçOur `Sales_data` class does not define any constructors, yet the programs we've written that use Sales_data objects compile and run correctly. As an example, the program on page 255 defined two objects: 

```c++
Sales_data total; // variable to hold the running sum 
Sales_data trans; // variable to hold data for the next transaction 
```

The question naturally arises: How are total and trans initialized? 

We did not supply an initializer for these objects, so we know that they are default initialized (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43). Classes control default initialization by defining a special constructor, known as the **default constructor**. The default constructor is one that takes no arguments. 

As we'll, see the default constructor is special in various ways, one of which is that if our class does not explicitly define any constructors, the compiler will implicitly define the default constructor for us 

The compiler-generated constructor is known as the **synthesized default constructor**. For most classes, this synthesized constructor initializes each data member of the class as follows: 

* If there is an in-class initializer (¬ß 2.6.1, p. 73), use it to initialize the member. 
* Otherwise, default-initialize (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43) the member. 

Because Sales_data provides initializers for units_sold and revenue, the synthesized default constructor uses those values 
to initialize those members. It default initializes bookNo to the empty string. 
Some Classes Cannot Rely on the Synthesized Default Constructor 

Only fairly simple classes‚Äîsuch as the current definition of `Sales_data`‚Äîcan rely on the synthesized default constructor. The most common reason that a class must define its own default constructor is that the compiler generates the default for us only if we do not define any other constructors for the class. If we define any constructors, the class will not have a default constructor unless we define that constructor ourselves. The basis for this rule is that if a class requires control to initialize an object in one case, then the class is likely to require control in all cases. 

> **Note** 
> The compiler generates a default constructor automatically only if a class declares no constructors. 

A second reason to define the default constructor is that for some classes, the synthesized default constructor does the wrong thing. Remember that objects of built-in or compound type (such as arrays and pointers) that are defined inside a block have undefined value when they are default initialized (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43). The same rule applies to members of built-in type that are default initialized. Therefore, classes that have members of built-in or compound type should ordinarily either initialize those members inside the class or define their own version of the default constructor. Otherwise, users could create objects with members that have undefined value. 

Warning 
Classes that have members of built-in or compound type usually should rely on the synthesized default constructor only if all such members have in-class initializers. 
A third reason that some classes must define their own default constructor is that sometimes the compiler is unable to synthesize one. For example, if a class has a member that has a class type, and that class doesn't have a default constructor, then the compiler can't initialize that member. For such classes, we must define our own version of the default constructor. Otherwise, the class will not have a usable default constructor. We'll see in ¬ß 13.1.6 
(p. 508) additional circumstances that prevent the compiler from generating an appropriate default constructor. 
Defining the Sales_data Constructors 
For our Sales_data class we'll define four constructors with the following parameters: 
. 
An istream& from which to read a transaction. 

.A 
const string& representing an ISBN, an unsigned representing the count of how many books were sold, and a double representing the price at which the books sold. 

.A 
const string& representing an ISBN. This constructor will use default values for the other members. 

. 
An empty parameter list (i.e., the default constructor) which as we've just seen we must define because we have defined other constructors. 


Adding these members to our class, we now have 
struct Sales_data { 
// constructors added 
Sales_data() = default; 
Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s) { } 
Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p): 
bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { } 
Sales_data(std::istream &); 
// other members as before 
std::string isbn() const { return bookNo; } 
Sales_data& combine(const Sales_data&); 
double avg_price() const; 
std::string bookNo; 
unsigned units_sold = 0; 
double revenue = 0.0; 
}; 
What = default Means 
We'll start by explaining the default constructor: 
Sales_data() = default; 
First, note that this constructor defines the default constructor because it takes no arguments. We are defining this constructor only because we want to provide other constructors as well as the default constructor. We want this constructor to do exactly the same work as the synthesized version we had been using. 
Under the new standard, if we want the default behavior, we can ask the compiler to generate the constructor for us by writing = 
default 
after the parameter list. The = default can appear with the declaration inside the class body or on the definition outside the class body. Like any other function, if the = default appears inside the class body, the default constructor will be inlined; if it appears on the definition outside the class, 
the member will not be inlined by default. 

Warning 
The default constructor works for Sales_data only because we provide initializers for the data members with built-in type. If your compiler does not support in-class initializers, your default constructor should use the constructor initializer list (described immediately following) to initialize every member of the class. 
Constructor Initializer List 
Next we'll look at the other two constructors that were defined inside the class: 
Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s) { } Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p): bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { } 
The new parts in these definitions are the colon and the code between it and the curly braces that define the (empty) function bodies. This new part is a constructor 
initializer 
list, which specifies initial values for one or more data members of the object being created. The constructor initializer is a list of member names, each of which is followed by that member's initial value in parentheses (or inside curly braces). Multiple member initializations are separated by commas. 
The constructor that has three parameters uses its first two parameters to initialize the bookNo and units_sold members. The initializer for revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of books sold by the price per book. 
The constructor that has a single string parameter uses that string to initialize bookNo but does not explicitly initialize the units_sold and revenue members. When a member is omitted from the constructor initializer list, it is implicitly initialized using the same process as is used by the synthesized default constructor. In this case, those members are initialized by the in-class initializers. Thus, the constructor that takes a string is equivalent to 
// has the same behavior as the original constructor defined above Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s), units_sold(0), revenue(0){ } 
It is usually best for a constructor to use an in-class initializer if one exists and gives the member the correct value. On the other hand, if your compiler does not yet support in-class initializers, then every constructor should explicitly initialize every member of built-in type. 

Best Practices 
Constructors should not override in-class initializers except to use a different initial value. If you can't use in-class initializers, each constructor should explicitly initialize every member of built-in type. 
It is worth noting that both constructors have empty function bodies. The only work these constructors need to do is give the data members their values. If there is no further work, then the function body is empty. 
Defining a Constructor outside the Class Body 
Unlike our other constructors, the constructor that takes an istream does have work to do. Inside its function body, this constructor calls read to give the data members new values: 
Sales_data::Sales_data(std::istream &is) { read(is, *this); // read will read a transaction from is into this 
object 
} Constructors have no return type, so this definition starts with the name of the function we are defining. As with any other member function, when we define a constructor outside of the class body, we must specify the class of which the constructor is a member. Thus, Sales_data::Sales_data says that we're defining the Sales_data member named Sales_data. This member is a constructor because it has the same name as its class. 
In this constructor there is no constructor initializer list, although technically speaking, it would be more correct to say that the constructor initializer list is empty. Even though the constructor initializer list is empty, the members of this object are still initialized before the constructor body is executed. 
Members that do not appear in the constructor initializer list are initialized by the corresponding in-class initializer (if there is one) or are default initialized. For Sales_data that means that when the function body starts executing, bookNo will be the empty string, and units_sold and revenue will both be 0. 
To understand the call to read, remember that read's second parameter is a reference to a Sales_data object. In ¬ß 7.1.2 
(p. 259), we noted that we use this to access the object as a whole, rather than a member of the object. In this case, we use *this to pass 'this' object as an argument to the read function. 
Exercises Section 7.1.4 Exercise 7.11: Add constructors to your Sales_data 
class and write a program to use each of the constructors. Exercise 7.12: Move the definition of the Sales_data 
constructor that takes an istream into the body of the 
Sales_data class. Exercise 7.13: Rewrite the program from page 255 
to use the istream constructor. 
Exercise 7.14: Write a version of the default constructor that explicitly initializes the members to the values we have provided as in-class initializers. 
Exercise 7.15: Add appropriate constructors to your Person class. 
7.1.5. Copy, Assignment, and Destruction 

In addition to defining how objects of the class type are initialized, classes also control what happens when we copy, assign, or destroy objects of the class type. Objects are copied in several contexts, such as when we initialize a variable or when we pass or return an object by value (¬ß 6.2.1, p. 209, and ¬ß 6.3.2, p. 224). Objects are assigned when we use the assignment operator (¬ß 4.4, p. 144). Objects are destroyed when they cease to exist, such as when a local object is destroyed on exit from the block in which it was created (¬ß 6.1.1, p. 204). Objects stored in a vector (or an array) are destroyed when that vector (or array) is destroyed. 
If we do not define these operations, the compiler will synthesize them for us. Ordinarily, the versions that the compiler generates for us execute by copying, assigning, or destroying each member of the object. For example, in our bookstore program in ¬ß 7.1.1 
(p. 255), when the compiler executes this assignment 
total = trans; // process the next book 
it executes as if we had written 
// default assignment for Sales_data is equivalent to: 
total.bookNo = trans.bookNo; 
total.units_sold = trans.units_sold; 
total.revenue = trans.revenue; We'll show how we can define our own versions of these operations in Chapter 
13. 
Some Classes Cannot Rely on the Synthesized Versions 

Although the compiler will synthesize the copy, assignment, and destruction operations for us, it is important to understand that for some classes the default versions do not behave appropriately. In particular, the synthesized versions are unlikely to work correctly for classes that allocate resources that reside outside the class objects themselves. As one example, in Chapter 
12 
we'll see how C++ programs allocate and manage dynamic memory. As we'll see in ¬ß 13.1.4 
(p. 504), classes that manage dynamic memory, generally cannot rely on the synthesized versions of these operations. 
However, it is worth noting that many classes that need dynamic memory can (and generally should) use a vector or a string to manage the necessary storage. Classes that use vectors and strings avoid the complexities involved in allocating and deallocating memory. 
Moreover, the synthesized versions for copy, assignment, and destruction work correctly for classes that have vector or string members. When we copy or assign an object that has a vector member, the vector class takes care of copying or assigning the elements in that member. When the object is destroyed, the vector member is destroyed, which in turn destroys the elements in the vector. Similarly for strings. 

Warning 
Until you know how to define the operations covered in Chapter 
13, the resources your classes allocate should be stored directly as data members of the class. 

7.2. Access Control and Encapsulation 

At this point, we have defined an interface for our class; but nothing forces users to use that interface. Our class is not yet encapsulated'users can reach inside a Sales_data object and meddle 
with 
its 
implementation. 
In 
C++ 
we 
use 
access 
specifiers 
to 
enforce 
encapsulation: 

. 
Members defined after a public specifier are accessible to all parts of the program. The public members define the interface to the class. 

. 
Members defined after a private specifier are accessible to the member functions of the class but are not accessible to code that uses the class. The private sections encapsulate (i.e., hide) the implementation. 


Redefining Sales_data once again, we now have 
class Sales_data { 
public: // access specifier added Sales_data() = default; Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p): 
bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { } Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s) { } Sales_data(std::istream&); std::string isbn() const { return bookNo; } Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&); 
private: // access specifier added double avg_price() const 
{ return units_sold ? revenue/units_sold : 0; } std::string bookNo; unsigned units_sold = 0; double revenue = 0.0; 
}; 
The constructors and member functions that are part of the interface (e.g., isbn and combine) follow the public specifier; the data members and the functions that are part of the implementation follow the private specifier. 
A class may contain zero or more access specifiers, and there are no restrictions on how often an access specifier may appear. Each access specifier specifies the access level of the succeeding members. The specified access level remains in effect until the next access specifier or the end of the class body. 
Using the class or struct Keyword 
We 
also 
made 
another, 
more 
subtle, 
change: 
We 
used 
the 
class 
keyword 
rather 
than 
struct 
to 
open 
the 
class 
definition. 
This 
change is strictly stylistic; we can define a class type using either keyword. The only difference between struct and class is the default access level. 
A class may define members before the first access specifier. Access to such members depends on how the class is defined. If we use the struct keyword, the members defined before the first access specifier are public; if we use class, then the members are private. 
As a matter of programming style, when we define a class intending for all of its members to be public, we use struct. If we intend to have private members, then we use class. 

Note 
The only difference between using class and using struct to define a class is the default access level. 
Exercises Section 7.2 Exercise 7.16: What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an access specifier may appear inside a class definition? What kinds of members should 
be defined after a public specifier? What kinds should 
be private? Exercise 7.17: What, if any, are the differences between using class or struct? 
Exercise 7.18: What is encapsulation? Why is it useful? Exercise 7.19: Indicate which members of your Person class you would declare as public and which you would declare as private. Explain your choice. 
7.2.1. Friends 

Now that the data members of Sales_data are private, our read, print, and add functions will no longer compile. The problem is that although these functions are part of the Sales_data interface, they are not members of the class. 
A class can allow another class or function to access its nonpublic members by making that class or function a friend. A class makes a function its friend by including a declaration for that function preceded by the keyword friend: 
class Sales_data { // friend declarations for nonmember Sales_data operations added 
friend Sales_data add(const Sales_data&, const Sales_data&); friend std::istream &read(std::istream&, Sales_data&); friend std::ostream &print(std::ostream&, const Sales_data&); // other members and access specifiers as before public: 
Sales_data() = default; Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p): bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { } 
Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s) { } Sales_data(std::istream&); std::string isbn() const { return bookNo; } Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&); 
private: std::string bookNo; unsigned units_sold = 0; double revenue = 0.0; 
}; // declarations for nonmember parts of the Sales_data interface Sales_data add(const Sales_data&, const Sales_data&); std::istream &read(std::istream&, Sales_data&); std::ostream &print(std::ostream&, const Sales_data&); 
Friend declarations may appear only inside a class definition; they may appear anywhere in the class. Friends are not members of the class and are not affected by the access control of the section in which they are declared. We'll have more to say about friendship in ¬ß 7.3.4 
(p. 279). 

Tip 
Ordinarily it is a good idea to group friend declarations together at the beginning or end of the class definition. 
Key Concept: Benefits of Encapsulation 
Encapsulation provides two important advantages: 
. 
User code cannot inadvertently corrupt the state of an encapsulated object. 

. 
The implementation of an encapsulated class can change over time without requiring changes in user-level code. 


By defining data members as private, the class author is free to make changes in the data. If the implementation changes, only the class code needs to be examined to see what effect the change may have. User code needs to change only when the interface changes. If the data are public, then any code that used the old data members might be broken. It would be necessary to locate and rewrite any code that relied on the old representation before the program could be used again. 
Another advantage of making data members private is that the data are protected from mistakes that users might introduce. If there is a bug that corrupts an object's state, the places to look for the bug are localized: Only code that is part of the implementation could be responsible for the error. The search for the mistake is limited, greatly easing the problems of maintenance and program correctness. 

Note 
Although user code need not change when a class definition changes, the source files that use a class must be recompiled any time the class changes. 
Declarations for Friends 

A friend declaration only specifies access. It is not a general declaration of the function. If we want users of the class to be able to call a friend function, then we must also declare the function separately from the friend declaration. 
To make a friend visible to users of the class, we usually declare each friend (outside the class) in the same header as the class itself. Thus, our Sales_data header should provide separate declarations (aside from the friend declarations inside the class body) for read, print, and add. 

Note 
Many compilers do not enforce the rule that friend functions must be declared outside the class before they can be used. 
Some compilers allow calls to a friend function when there is no ordinary declaration for that function. Even if your compiler allows such calls, it is a good idea to provide separate declarations for friends. That way you won't have to change your code if you use a compiler that enforces this rule. 
Exercises Section 7.2.1 
Exercise 7.20: When are friends useful? Discuss the pros and cons of using friends. Exercise 7.21: Update your Sales_data class to hide its 
implementation. The programs you've written to use Sales_data operations should still continue to work. Recompile those programs with your new class definition to verify that they still work. 
Exercise 7.22: Update your Person class to hide its implementation. 
7.3. Additional Class Features 
The Sales_data class is pretty simple, yet it allowed us to explore quite a bit of the language support for classes. In this section, we'll cover some additional class-related features that Sales_data doesn't need to use. These features include type members, in-class initializers for members of class type, mutable data members, inline member functions, returning *this from a member function, more about how we define and use class types, and class friendship. 
7.3.1. Class Members Revisited 
To explore several of these additional features, we'll define a pair of cooperating classes named Screen and Window_mgr. 
Defining a Type Member 
A Screen represents a window on a display. Each Screen has a string member that holds the Screen's contents, and three string::size_type members that represent the position of the cursor, and the height and width of the screen. 
In addition to defining data and function members, a class can define its own local names for types. Type names defined by a class are subject to the same access controls as any other member and may be either public or private: 
class Screen { 
public: 
typedef std::string::size_type pos; 
private: 
pos cursor = 0; 
pos height = 0, width = 0; 
std::string contents; 
}; 
We defined pos in the public part of Screen because we want users to use that name. Users of Screen shouldn't know that Screen uses a string to hold its data. By defining pos as a public member, we can hide this detail of how Screen is implemented. 
There are two points to note about the declaration of pos. First, although we used a typedef (¬ß 2.5.1, p. 67), we can equivalently use a type alias (¬ß 2.5.1, p. 68): 
class Screen { 
public: // alternative way to declare a type member using a type alias using pos = std::string::size_type; // other members as before 
}; 
The second point is that, for reasons we'll explain in ¬ß 7.4.1 
(p. 284), unlike ordinary members, members that define types must appear before they are used. As a result, type members usually appear at the beginning of the class. 
Member Functions of class Screen 
To make our class more useful, we'll add a constructor that will let users define the size and contents of the screen, along with members to move the cursor and to get the character at a given location: 
class Screen { public: typedef std::string::size_type pos; Screen() = default; // needed because Screen has another constructor // cursor initialized to 0 by its in-class initializer Screen(pos ht, pos wd, char c): height(ht), width(wd), contents(ht * wd, c) { } char get() const // get the character at the cursor { return contents[cursor]; } // implicitly inline inline char get(pos ht, pos wd) const; // explicitly inline Screen &move(pos r, pos c); // can be made inline later 
private: 
pos cursor = 0; 
pos height = 0, width = 0; 
std::string contents; 
}; Because we have provided a constructor, the compiler will not automatically generate a default constructor for us. If our class is to have a default constructor, we must say so explicitly. In this case, we use = default to ask the compiler to synthesize the default constructor's definition for us (¬ß 7.1.4, p. 264). 
It's also worth noting that our second constructor (that takes three arguments) implicitly uses the in-class initializer for the cursor member (¬ß 7.1.4, p. 266). If our class did not have an in-class initializer for cursor, we would have explicitly initialized cursor along with the other members. 
Making Members inline 
Classes often have small functions that can benefit from being inlined. As we've seen, member functions defined inside the class are automatically inline (¬ß 6.5.2, p. 238). Thus, Screen's constructors and the version of get that returns the character denoted by the cursor are inline by default. 
We can explicitly declare a member function as inline as part of its declaration inside the class body. Alternatively, we can specify inline on the function definition that appears outside the class body: 
inline // we can specify inline on the definition 
Screen &Screen::move(pos r, pos c) 
{ pos row = r * width; // compute the row location cursor =row +c; // move cursor to the column within that row return *this; // return this object as an lvalue 
} char Screen::get(pos r, pos c) const // declared as inline in the class 
{ pos row = r * width; // compute row location return contents[row + c]; // return character at the given column 
} 
Although we are not required to do so, it is legal to specify inline on both the declaration and the definition. However, specifying inline only on the definition outside the class can make the class easier to read. 

Note 
For the same reasons that we define inline functions in headers (¬ß 6.5.2, p. 240), inline member functions should be defined in the same header as the corresponding class definition. 
Overloading Member Functions 
As with nonmember functions, member functions may be overloaded (¬ß 6.4, p. 230) so long as the functions differ by the number and/or types of parameters. The same function-matching (¬ß 6.4, p. 233) process is used for calls to member functions as for nonmember functions. 
For example, our Screen class defined two versions of get. One version returns the character currently denoted by the cursor; the other returns the character at a given position specified by its row and column. The compiler uses the number of arguments to determine which version to run: 
Screen myscreen; 
char ch = myscreen.get();// calls Screen::get() 
ch = myscreen.get(0,0); // calls Screen::get(pos, pos) 
mutable Data Members 
It sometimes (but not very often) happens that a class has a data member that we want to be able to modify, even inside a const member function. We indicate such members by including the mutable keyword in their declaration. 
A mutable 
data 
member 
is never const, even when it is a member of a const object. Accordingly, a const member function may change a mutable member. As an example, we'll give Screen a mutable member named access_ctr, which we'll use to track how often each Screen member function is called: 
class Screen { public: void some_member() const; private: mutable size_t access_ctr; // may change even in a const object // other members as before }; void Screen::some_member() const { ++access_ctr; // keep a count of the calls to any member function // whatever other work this member needs to do } 
Despite the fact that some_member is a const member function, it can change the value of access_ctr. That member is a mutable member, so any member function, including const functions, can change its value. 
Initializers for Data Members of Class Type 

In addition to defining the Screen class, we'll define a window manager class that represents a collection of Screens on a given display. This class will have a vector of Screens in which each element represents a particular Screen. By default, we'd like our Window_mgr class to start up with a single, default-initialized Screen. Under the new standard, the best way to specify this default value is as an in-class initializer (¬ß 2.6.1, p. 73): 
class Window_mgr { private: // Screens this Window_mgr is tracking // by default, a Window_mgr has one standard sized blank Screen std::vector<Screen> screens{Screen(24, 80, ' ') }; }; 
When we initialize a member of class type, we are supplying arguments to a constructor of that member's type. In this case, we list initialize our vector member (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 98) with a single element initializer. That initializer contains a Screen value that is passed to the vector<Screen> constructor to create a one-element vector. That value is created by the Screen constructor that takes two size parameters and a character to create a blank screen of the given size. 
As we've seen, in-class initializers must use either the = form of initialization (which we used when we initialized the the data members of Screen) or the direct form of initialization using curly braces (as we do for screens). 

Note 
When we provide an in-class initializer, we must do so following an = sign or inside braces. 
Exercises Section 7.3.1 Exercise 7.23: Write your own version of the Screen class. Exercise 7.24: Give your Screen class three constructors: a 
default constructor; a constructor that takes values for height and width and initializes the contents to hold the given number of blanks; and a constructor that takes values for height, width, and a character to use as the contents of the screen. 
Exercise 7.25: Can Screen safely rely on the default versions of copy and assignment? If so, why? If not, why not? 
Exercise 7.26: Define Sales_data::avg_price as an inline function. 
7.3.2. Functions That Return *this 

Next we'll add functions to set the character at the cursor or at a given location: 
class Screen { 
public: Screen &set(char); Screen &set(pos, pos, char); // other members as before 
}; inline Screen &Screen::set(char c) { 
contents[cursor] = c; // set the new value at the current cursor location 
return *this; // return this object as an lvalue } inline Screen &Screen::set(pos r, pos col, char ch) 
{ contents[r*width given value return *this; lvalue  + col]  =  ch;  // set specified location to // return this object as an  
}  

Like the move operation, our set members return a reference to the object on which they are called (¬ß 7.1.2, p. 259). Functions that return a reference are lvalues (¬ß 6.3.2, p. 226), which means that they return the object itself, not a copy of the object. If we concatenate a sequence of these actions into a single expression: 
// move the cursor to a given position, and set that character 
myScreen.move(4,0).set('#'); 
these operations will execute on the same object. In this expression, we first move the cursor inside myScreen and then set a character in myScreen's contents member. That is, this statement is equivalent to 
myScreen.move(4,0); 
myScreen.set('#'); 
Had we defined move and set to return Screen, rather than Screen&, this statement would execute quite differently. In this case it would be equivalent to: 
// if move returns Screen not Screen& Screen temp = myScreen.move(4,0); // the return value would be copied temp.set('#'); // the contents inside myScreen would be unchanged 
If move had a nonreference return type, then the return value of move would be a copy of *this (¬ß 6.3.2, p. 224). The call to set would change the temporary copy, not myScreen. 
Returning *this from a const Member Function 
Next, we'll add an operation, which we'll name display, to print the contents of the Screen. We'd like to be able to include this operation in a sequence of set and move operations. Therefore, like set and move, our display function will return a reference to the object on which it executes. 
Logically, displaying a Screen doesn't change the object, so we should make display a const member. If display is a const member, then this is a pointer to const and *this is a const object. Hence, the return type of display must be const Sales_data&. However, if display returns a reference to const, we won't be able to embed display into a series of actions: 
Screen myScreen; 
// if display returns a const reference, the call to set is an error 
myScreen.display(cout).set('*'); Even though myScreen is a nonconst object, the call to set won't compile. The problem is that the const version of display returns a reference to const and we cannot call set on a const object. 

Note 
A const member function that returns *this as a reference should have a return type that is a reference to const. 
Overloading Based on const 
We can overload a member function based on whether it is const for the same reasons that we can overload a function based on whether a pointer parameter points to const (¬ß 6.4, p. 232). The nonconst version will not be viable for const objects; we can only call const member functions on a const object. We can call either version on a nonconst object, but the nonconst version will be a better match. 
In this example, we'll define a private member named do_display to do the actual work of printing the Screen. Each of the display operations will call this function and then return the object on which it is executing: 
class Screen { 
public: 
// display overloaded on whether the object is const or not 
Screen &display(std::ostream &os) { do_display(os); return *this; } const Screen &display(std::ostream &os) const { do_display(os); return *this; } private: // function to do the work of displaying a Screen void do_display(std::ostream &os) const {os << contents;} // other members as before }; 
As in any other context, when one member calls another the this pointer is passed implicitly. Thus, when display calls do_display, its own this pointer is implicitly passed to do_display. When the nonconst version of display calls do_display, its this pointer is implicitly converted from a pointer to nonconst to a pointer to const (¬ß 4.11.2, p. 162). 
When do_display completes, the display functions each return the object on which they execute by dereferencing this. In the nonconst version, this points to a nonconst object, so that version of display returns an ordinary (nonconst) reference; the const member returns a reference to const. 
When we call display on an object, whether that object is const determines which version of display is called: 
Screen myScreen(5,3); 
const Screen blank(5, 3); 
myScreen.set('#').display(cout); // calls non const version 
blank.display(cout); // calls const version 
Advice: Use Private Utility Functions for Common Code 
Some readers might be surprised that we bothered to define a separate do_display operation. After all, the calls to do_display aren't much simpler than the action done inside do_display. Why bother? We do so for several reasons: 
. 
A general desire to avoid writing the same code in more than one place. 

. 
We expect that the display operation will become more complicated as our class evolves. As the actions involved become more complicated, it makes more obvious sense to write those actions in one place, not two. 

. 
It is likely that we might want to add debugging information to do_display during development that would be eliminated in the final product version of the code. It will be easier to do so if only one definition of do_display needs to be changed to add or remove the debugging code. 

. 
There needn't be any overhead involved in this extra function call. We defined do_display inside the class body, so it is implicitly inline. Thus, there likely be no run-time overhead associating with calling do_display. 

In practice, well-designed C++ programs tend to have lots of small functions such as do_display that are called to do the 'real' work of some other set of functions. 

#### 7.3.3. Class Types 

Every class defines a unique type. Two different classes define two different types even if they define the same members. For example:

```C++
struct First {
    int memi;
    int getMem();
};
struct Second {
    int memi;
    int getMem();
};
First obj1;
Second obj2 = obj1; // error: obj1 and obj2 have different types
```



Note 
Even if two classes have exactly the same member list, they are different types. The members of each class are distinct from the members of any other class (or any other scope). 
We can refer to a class type directly, by using the class name as a type name. Alternatively, we can use the class name following the keyword class or struct: 
Sales_data item1; // default-initialized object of type Sales_data class Sales_data item1; // equivalent declaration 
Both methods of referring to a class type are equivalent. The second method is inherited from C and is also valid in C++. 
Class Declarations 
Just as we can declare a function apart from its definition (¬ß 6.1.2, p. 206), we can also declare a class without defining it: 
class Screen; // declaration of the Screen class 
This 
declaration, 
sometimes 
referred 
to 
as 
a 
forward 
declaration, 
introduces 
the 
name 
Screen 
into 
the 
program 
and indicates that Screen refers to a class type. After a declaration and before a definition is seen, the type Screen is an incomplete 
type'it's known that Screen is a class type but not known what members that type contains. 
We can use an incomplete type in only limited ways: We can define pointers or references to such types, and we can declare (but not define) functions that use an incomplete type as a parameter or return type. 
A class must be defined'not just declared'before we can write code that creates objects of that type. Otherwise, the compiler does not know how much storage such objects need. Similarly, the class must be defined before a reference or pointer is used to access a member of the type. After all, if the class has not been defined, the compiler can't know what members the class has. 
With one exception that we'll describe in ¬ß 7.6 
(p. 300), data members can be specified to be of a class type only if the class has been defined. The type must be complete because the compiler needs to know how much storage the data member requires. Because a class is not defined until its class body is complete, a class cannot have data members of its own type. However, a class is considered declared (but not yet defined) as soon as its class name has been seen. Therefore, a class can have data members that are pointers or references to its own type: 
class Link_screen { Screen window; Link_screen *next; Link_screen *prev; 
}; 
Exercises Section 7.3.3 Exercise 7.31: Define a pair of classes X and Y, in which X has a pointer to Y, and Y has an object of type X. 
7.3.4. Friendship Revisited 
Our Sales_data class defined three ordinary nonmember functions as friends (¬ß 7.2.1, p. 269). A class can also make another class its friend or it can declare specific member functions of another (previously defined) class as friends. In addition, a friend function can be defined inside the class body. Such functions are implicitly inline. 
Friendship between Classes 
As an example of class friendship, our Window_mgr class (¬ß 7.3.1, 
p. 274) will have members that will need access to the internal data of the Screen objects it manages. For example, let's assume that we want to add a member, named clear to Window_mgr that will reset the contents of a particular Screen to all blanks. To do this job, clear needs to access the private data members of Screen. To allow this access, Screen can designate Window_mgr as its friend: 
class Screen { // Window_mgr members can access the private parts of class Screen 
friend class Window_mgr; // ... rest of the Screen class }; 
The member functions of a friend class can access all the members, including the nonpublic members, of the class granting friendship. Now that Window_mgr is a friend of Screen, we can write the clear member of Window_mgr as follows: 
class Window_mgr { 
public: 
// location ID for each screen on the window 
using ScreenIndex = std::vector<Screen>::size_type; 
// reset the Screen at the given position to all blanks 
void clear(ScreenIndex); 
private: 
std::vector<Screen> screens{Screen(24, 80, ' ')}; 
}; 
void Window_mgr::clear(ScreenIndex i) 
{ 
// s is a reference to the Screen we want to clear 
Screen &s = screens[i]; 
// reset the contents of that Screen to all blanks 
s.contents = string(s.height * s.width, ' '); 
} 
We start by defining s as a reference to the Screen at position i in the screens vector. We then use the height and width members of that Screen to compute anew string that has the appropriate number of blank characters. We assign that string of blanks to the contents member. 
If clear were not a friend of Screen, this code would not compile. The clear function would not be allowed to use the height width, or contents members of Screen. Because Screen grants friendship to Window_mgr, all the members of Screen are accessible to the functions in Window_mgr. 
It is important to understand that friendship is not transitive. That is, if class Window_mgr has its own friends, those friends have no special access to Screen. 

Note 
Each class controls which classes or functions are its friends. 
Making A Member Function a Friend 
Rather than making the entire Window_mgr class a friend, Screen can instead specify that only the clear member is allowed access. When we declare a member function to be a friend, we must specify the class of which that function is a member: 
class Screen { // Window_mgr::clear must have been declared before class Screen 
friend void Window_mgr::clear(ScreenIndex); // ... rest of the Screen class 
}; Making a member function a friend requires careful structuring of our programs to accommodate interdependencies among the declarations and definitions. In this example, we must order our program as follows: 
. 
First, define the Window_mgr class, which declares, but cannot define, clear. Screen must be declared before clear can use the members of Screen. 

. 
Next, define class Screen, including a friend declaration for clear. 

. 
Finally, define clear, which can now refer to the members in Screen. 


Overloaded Functions and Friendship 
Although overloaded functions share a common name, they are still different functions. Therefore, a class must declare as a friend each function in a set of overloaded functions that it wishes to make a friend: 
// overloaded storeOn functions 
extern std::ostream& storeOn(std::ostream &, Screen &); 
extern BitMap& storeOn(BitMap &, Screen &); 
class Screen { 
// ostream version of storeOn may access the private parts of 
Screen objects 
friend std::ostream& storeOn(std::ostream &, Screen 
&); 
// . . . 
}; Class Screen makes the version of storeOn that takes an ostream& its friend. The version that takes a BitMap& has no special access to Screen. 
Friend Declarations and Scope 
Classes and nonmember functions need not have been declared before they are used in a friend declaration. When a name first appears in a friend declaration, that name is implicitly assumed to be part of the surrounding scope. However, the friend itself is not actually declared in that scope (¬ß 7.2.1, p. 270). 
Even if we define the function inside the class, we must still provide a declaration outside of the class itself to make that function visible. A declaration must exist even if we only call the friend from members of the friendship granting class: 
struct X { friend void f() { /* friend function can be defined in the class body */ } X() { f(); }// error: no declaration for f 
void g(); 
void h(); }; void X::g() { return f(); } // error: f hasn't been declared void f(); // declares the function defined inside X void X::h() { return f(); } // ok: declaration for f is now in scope 
It is important to understand that a friend declaration affects access but is not a declaration in an ordinary sense. 

Note 
Remember, some compilers do not enforce the lookup rules for friends (¬ß 7.2.1, p. 270). 
Exercises Section 7.3.4 Exercise 7.32: Define your own versions of Screen and Window_mgr in which clear is a member of Window_mgr and a friend of Screen. 
7.4. Class Scope 

Every class defines its own new scope. Outside the class scope, ordinary data and function members may be accessed only through an object, a reference, or a pointer using a member access operator (¬ß 4.6, p. 150). We access type members from the class using the scope operator . In either case, the name that follows the operator must be a member of the associated class. 
Screen::pos ht = 24, wd = 80; // use the pos type defined by ScreenScreen scr(ht, wd, ' '); Screen *p = &scr; char c = scr.get(); // fetches the get member from the object scr c = p->get(); // fetches the get member from the object to which p points 
Scope and Members Defined outside the Class 
The fact that a class is a scope explains why we must provide the class name as well as the function name when we define a member function outside its class (¬ß 7.1.2, p. 259). Outside of the class, the names of the members are hidden. 
Once the class name is seen, the remainder of the definition' including the parameter list and the function body'is in the scope of the class. As a result, we can refer to other class members without qualification. 
For example, recall the clear member of class Window_mgr (¬ß 7.3.4, p. 280). That function's parameter uses a type that is defined by Window_mgr: 
void Window_mgr::clear(ScreenIndex i) { Screen &s = screens[i]; 
s.contents = string(s.height * s.width, ' '); } 
Because the compiler sees the parameter list after noting that we are in the scope of class WindowMgr, there is no need to specify that we want the ScreenIndex that is defined by WindowMgr. For the same reason, the use of screens in the function body refers to name declared inside class Window_mgr. 
On the other hand, the return type of a function normally appears before the function's name. When a member function is defined outside the class body, any name used in the return type is outside the class scope. As a result, the return type must specify the class of which it is a member. For example, we might give Window_mgr a function, named addScreen, to add another screen to the display. This member will return a ScreenIndex value that the user can subsequently use to locate this Screen: 
class Window_mgr { public: // add a Screen to the window and returns its index 
ScreenIndex addScreen(const Screen&); 
// other members as before }; // return type is seen before we're in the scope of Window_mgr Window_mgr::ScreenIndex Window_mgr::addScreen(const Screen &s) { 
screens.push_back(s); return screens.size() -1; } 
Because the return type appears before the name of the class is seen, it appears outside the scope of class Window_mgr. To use ScreenIndex for the return type, we must specify the class in which that type is defined. 
Exercises Section 7.4 
Exercise 7.33: What would happen if we gave Screen a size member defined as follows? Fix any problems you identify. 
pos Screen::size() const { 
return height * width; } 
7.4.1. Name Lookup and Class Scope 

In the programs we've written so far, name 
lookup 
(the process of finding which declarations match the use of a name) has been relatively straightforward: 
. 
First, look for a declaration of the name in the block in which the name was used. Only names declared before the use are considered. 

. 
If the name isn't found, look in the enclosing scope(s). 

. 
If no declaration is found, then the program is in error. 


The way names are resolved inside member functions defined inside the class may seem to behave differently than these lookup rules. However, in this case, appearances are deceiving. Class definitions are processed in two phases: 
. 
First, the member declarations are compiled. 

. 
Function bodies are compiled only after the entire class has been seen. 



Note 
Member function definitions are processed after the compiler processes all of the declarations in the class. 

Classes are processed in this two-phase way to make it easier to organize class code. Because member function bodies are not processed until the entire class is seen, they can use any name defined inside the class. If function definitions were processed at the same time as the member declarations, then we would have to order the member functions so that they referred only to names already seen. 
Name Lookup for Class Member Declarations 
This two-step process applies only to names used in the body of a member function. Names used in declarations, including names used for the return type and types in the parameter list, must be seen before they are used. If a member declaration uses a name that has not yet been seen inside the class, the compiler will look for that name in the scope(s) in which the class is defined. For example: 
typedef double Money; 
string bal; 
class Account { 
public: 
Money balance() { return bal; } 
private: 
Money bal; 
// ... 
}; 
When the compiler sees the declaration of the balance function, it will look for a declaration of Money in the Account class. The compiler considers only declarations inside Account that appear before the use of Money. Because no matching member is found, the compiler then looks for a declaration in the enclosing scope(s). In this example, the compiler will find the typedef of Money. That type will be used for the return type of the function balance and as the type for the data member bal. On the other hand, the function body of balance is processed only after the entire class is seen. Thus, the return inside that function returns the member named bal, not the string from the outer scope. 
Type Names Are Special 
Ordinarily, an inner scope can redefine a name from an outer scope even if that name has already been used in the inner scope. However, in a class, if a member uses a name from an outer scope and that name is a type, then the class may not subsequently redefine that name: 
typedef double Money; class Account { public: 
Money balance() { return bal; } // uses Money from the outer scope 
private: typedef double Money; // error: cannot redefine Money Money bal; // ... 
}; 
It is worth noting that even though the definition of Money inside Account uses the same type as the definition in the outer scope, this code is still in error. 
Although it is an error to redefine a type name, compilers are not required to diagnose this error. Some compilers will quietly accept such code, even though the program is in error. 

Tip 
Definitions of type names usually should appear at the beginning of a class. That way any member that uses that type will be seen after the type name has already been defined. 
Normal Block-Scope Name Lookup inside Member Definitions 
A name used in the body of a member function is resolved as follows: 
. 
First, look for a declaration of the name inside the member function. As usual, only declarations in the function body that precede the use of the name are considered. 

. 
If the declaration is not found inside the member function, look for a declaration inside the class. All the members of the class are considered. 

. 
If a declaration for the name is not found in the class, look for a declaration that is in scope before the member function definition. 


Ordinarily, it is a bad idea to use the name of another member as the name for a parameter in a member function. However, in order to show how names are resolved, we'll violate that normal practice in our dummy_fcn function: 
// note: this code is for illustration purposes only and reflects bad practice // it is generally a bad idea to use the same name for a parameter and a member int height; // defines a name subsequently used inside Screen 
class Screen { 
public: 
typedef std::string::size_type pos; 
void dummy_fcn(pos height) { 
cursor = width * height; // which height? the parameter } 
private: 
pos cursor = 0; 
pos height = 0, width = 0; 
}; 
When the compiler processes the multiplication expression inside dummy_fcn, it first looks for the names used in that expression in the scope of that function. A function's parameters are in the function's scope. Thus, the name height, used in the body of dummy_fcn, refers to this parameter declaration. 
In this case, the height parameter hides the member named height. If we wanted to override the normal lookup rules, we can do so: 
// bad practice: names local to member functions shouldn't hide member 
names 
void Screen::dummy_fcn(pos height) { 
cursor = width * this->height; // member height 
// alternative way to indicate the member 
cursor = width * Screen::height; // member height 
} 

Note 
Even though the class member is hidden, it is still possible to use that member by qualifying the member's name with the name of its class or by using the this pointer explicitly. 
A much better way to ensure that we get the member named height would be to give the parameter a different name: 
// good practice: don't use a member name for a parameter or other local variable 
void Screen::dummy_fcn(pos ht) { cursor = width * height; // member height 
} 
In this case, when the compiler looks for the name height, it won't be found inside dummy_fcn. The compiler next looks at all the declarations in Screen. Even though the declaration of height appears after its use inside dummy_fcn, the compiler resolves this use to the data member named height. 
After Class Scope, Look in the Surrounding Scope 
If the compiler doesn't find the name in function or class scope, it looks for the name in the surrounding scope. In our example, the name height is defined in the outer scope before the definition of Screen. However, the object in the outer scope is hidden by our member named height. If we want the name from the outer scope, we can ask for it explicitly using the scope operator: 
// bad practice: don't hide names that are needed from surrounding scopes void Screen::dummy_fcn(pos height) { cursor = width * ::height;// which height? the global one 
} 

Note 
Even though the outer object is hidden, it is still possible to access that object by using the scope operator. 
Names Are Resolved Where They Appear within a File 
When a member is defined outside its class, the third step of name lookup includes names declared in the scope of the member definition as well as those that appear in the scope of the class definition. For example: 
int height; // defines a name subsequently used inside Screen 
class Screen { 
public: 
typedef std::string::size_type pos; 
void setHeight(pos); 
pos height = 0; // hides the declaration of height in the outer scope 
}; Screen::pos verify(Screen::pos); void Screen::setHeight(pos var) { 
// var: refers to the parameter // height: refers to the class member // verify: refers to the global function height = verify(var); 
} 
Notice that the declaration of the global function verify is not visible before the definition of the class Screen. However, the third step of name lookup includes the scope in which the member definition appears. In this example, the declaration for verify appears before setHeight is defined and may, therefore, be used.

Exercise 7.34: What would happen if we put the typedef of pos in the Screen class on page 285 
as the last line in the class?

7.5. Constructors Revisited 
Constructors are a crucial part of any C++ class. We covered the basics of constructors in ¬ß 7.1.4 
(p. 262). In this section we'll cover some additional capabilities of constructors, and deepen our coverage of the material introduced earlier. 
7.5.1. Constructor Initializer List 

When we define variables, we typically initialize them immediately rather than defining them and then assigning to them: 
string foo = "Hello World!"; // define and initialize string bar; // default initialized to the empty string bar = "Hello World!"; // assign a new value to bar 
Exactly the same distinction between initialization and assignment applies to the data members of objects. If we do not explicitly initialize a member in the constructor initializer list, that member is default initialized before the constructor body starts executing. For example: 
// legal but sloppier way to write the Sales_data constructor: no constructor initializers 
Sales_data::Sales_data(const string &s, unsigned cnt, double price) 
{ bookNo = s; units_sold = cnt; revenue = cnt * price; 
} 
This version and our original definition on page 264 
have the same effect: When the constructor finishes, the data members will hold the same values. The difference is that the original version initializes its data members, whereas this version assigns values to the data members. How significant this distinction is depends on the type of the data member. 
Constructor Initializers Are Sometimes Required 
We can often, but not always, ignore the distinction between whether a member is initialized or assigned. Members that are const or references must be initialized. Similarly, members that are of a class type that does not define a default constructor also must be initialized. For example: 
class ConstRef { 
public: 
ConstRef(int ii); 
private: 
int i; 
const int ci; 
int &ri; 
}; 
Like any other const object or reference, the members ci and ri must be initialized. As a result, omitting a constructor initializer for these members is an error: 
// error: ci and ri must be initialized 
ConstRef::ConstRef(int ii) 
{ // assignments: i = ii; // ok ci =ii; // error: cannot assign to a const ri =i; // error: ri was never initialized 
} 
By the time the body of the constructor begins executing, initialization is complete. Our only chance to initialize const or reference data members is in the constructor initializer. The correct way to write this constructor is 
// ok: explicitly initialize reference and const members 
ConstRef::ConstRef(int ii): i(ii), ci(ii), ri(i) { } 

Note 
We must use the constructor initializer list to provide values for members that are const, reference, or of a class type that does not have a default constructor. 
Advice: Use Constructor Initializers 
In many classes, the distinction between initialization and assignment is strictly a matter of low-level efficiency: A data member is initialized and then assigned when it could have been initialized directly. 
More important than the efficiency issue is the fact that some data members must be initialized. By routinely using constructor initializers, you can avoid being surprised by compile-time errors when you have a class with a member that requires a constructor initializer. 
Order of Member Initialization 
Not surprisingly, each member may be named only once in the constructor initializer. After all, what might it mean to give a member two initial values? 
What may be more surprising is that the constructor initializer list specifies only the values used to initialize the members, not the order in which those initializations are performed. 
Members are initialized in the order in which they appear in the class definition: The first member is initialized first, then the next, and so on. The order in which initializers appear in the constructor initializer list does not change the order of initialization. 
The order of initialization often doesn't matter. However, if one member is initialized in terms of another, then the order in which members are initialized is crucially important. 
As an example, consider the following class: 
class X { int i; int j; 
public: // undefined: i is initialized before j 
X(int val): j(val), i(j) { } }; 
In this case, the constructor initializer makes it appear as if j is initialized with val and then j is used to initialize i. However, i is initialized first. The effect of this initializer is to initialize i with the undefined value of j! 
Some compilers are kind enough to generate a warning if the data members are listed in the constructor initializer in a different order from the order in which the members are declared. 

Best Practices 
It is a good idea to write constructor initializers in the same order as the members are declared. Moreover, when possible, avoid using members to initialize other members. 
If possible, it is a good idea write member initializers to use the constructor's parameters rather than another data member from the same object. That way we don't even have to think about the order of member initialization. For example, it would be better to write the constructor for X as 
X(int val): i(val), j(val) { } 
In this version, the order in which i and j are initialized doesn't matter. 
Default Arguments and Constructors 
The actions of the Sales_data default constructor are similar to those of the constructor that takes a single string argument. The only difference is that the constructor that takes a string argument uses that argument to initialize bookNo. The default constructor (implicitly) uses the string default constructor to initialize bookNo. We can rewrite these constructors as a single constructor with a default argument (¬ß 6.5.1, p. 236): 
class Sales_data { public: // defines the default constructor as well as one that takes a string argument 
Sales_data(std::string s = ""): bookNo(s) { } 
// remaining constructors unchanged 
Sales_data(std::string s, unsigned cnt, double rev): 
bookNo(s), units_sold(cnt), revenue(rev*cnt) { } 
Sales_data(std::istream &is) { read(is, *this); } 
// remaining members as before 
}; 

This version of our class provides the same interface as our original on page 264. Both versions create the same object when given no arguments or when given a single string argument. Because we can call this constructor with no arguments, this constructor defines a default constructor for our class. 

Note 
A constructor that supplies default arguments for all its parameters also defines the default constructor. 

It is worth noting that we probably should not use default arguments with the Sales_data constructor that takes three arguments. If a user supplies a nonzero count for the number of books sold, we want to ensure that the user also supplies the price at which those books were sold.

Sales_data last("9-999-99999-9"); }

7.5.2. Delegating Constructors 

The new standard extends the use of constructor initializers to let us define so-called delegating 
constructors. A delegating constructor uses another constructor from its own class to perform its initialization. It is said to 'delegate' some (or all) of its work to this other constructor. 
Like any other constructor, a delegating constructor has a member initializer list and a function body. In a delegating constructor, the member initializer list has a single entry that is the name of the class itself. Like other member initializers, the name of the class is followed by a parenthesized list of arguments. The argument list must match another constructor in the class. 
As an example, we'll rewrite the Sales_data class to use delegating constructors as follows: 
class Sales_data { public: // nondelegating constructor initializes members from corresponding arguments 
Sales_data(std::string s, unsigned cnt, double price): 
bookNo(s), units_sold(cnt), revenue(cnt*price) { 
} 
// remaining constructors all delegate to another constructor 
Sales_data(): Sales_data("", 0, 0) {} 
Sales_data(std::string s): Sales_data(s, 0,0) {} 
Sales_data(std::istream &is): Sales_data() 
{ read(is, *this); } // other members as before }; 
In this version of Sales_data, all but one of the constructors delegate their work. The first constructor takes three arguments, uses those arguments to initialize the data members, and does no further work. In this version of the class, we define the default constructor to use the three-argument constructor to do its initialization. It too has no additional work, as indicated by the empty constructor body. The constructor that takes a string also delegates to the three-argument version. 
The constructor that takes an istream& also delegates. It delegates to the default constructor, which in turn delegates to the three-argument constructor. Once those constructors complete their work, the body of the istream& constructor is run. Its constructor body calls read to read the given istream. 
When a constructor delegates to another constructor, the constructor initializer list and function body of the delegated-to constructor are both executed. In Sales_data, the function bodies of the delegated-to constructors happen to be empty. Had the function bodies contained code, that code would be run before control returned to the function body of the delegating constructor. 
Exercises Section 7.5.2 Exercise 7.41: Rewrite your own version of the Sales_data class to use delegating constructors. Add a statement to the body of each of the constructors that 
prints a message whenever it is executed. Write declarations to construct a Sales_data object in every way possible. Study the output until you are certain you understand the order of execution among delegating constructors.

7.5.3. The Role of the Default Constructor 

The default constructor is used automatically whenever an object is default or value initialized. Default initialization happens 
. 
When we define nonstatic variables (¬ß 2.2.1, p. 43) or arrays (¬ß3.5.1, p. 114) at block scope without initializers 

. 
When a class that itself has members of class type uses the synthesized default constructor (¬ß 7.1.4, p. 262) 

. 
When members of class type are not explicitly initialized 


in a constructor initializer list (¬ß 7.1.4, p. 265) Value initialization happens 
. 
During array initialization when we provide fewer initializers than the size of the array (¬ß 3.5.1, p. 114) 

. 
When we define a local static object without an initializer (¬ß 6.1.1, p. 205) 

. 
When we explicitly request value initialization by writing an expressions of the form T() where T is the name of a 


type (The vector constructor that takes a single argument to specify the vector's size (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 98) uses an argument of this kind to value initialize its element initializer.) 
Classes must have a default constructor in order to be used in these contexts. Most of these contexts should be fairly obvious. 
What may be less obvious is the impact on classes that have data members that do not have a default constructor: 
class NoDefault { 
public: NoDefault(const std::string&); // additional members follow, but no other constructors 
}; struct A { // my_mem is public by default; see ¬ß 7.2 (p. 268) 
NoDefault my_mem; }; A a; // error: cannot synthesize a constructor for A struct B { 
B() {} // error: no initializer for b_member NoDefault b_member; }; 

Best Practices 
In practice, it is almost always right to provide a default constructor if other constructors are being defined. 
Using the Default Constructor 
The following declaration of obj compiles without complaint. However, when we try to use obj 
Sales_data obj(); // ok: but defines a function, not an object if (obj.isbn() == Primer_5th_ed.isbn()) // error: obj is a 
function 
the compiler complains that we cannot apply member access notation to a function. The problem is that, although we intended to declare a default-initialized object, obj actually declares a function taking no parameters and returning an object of type Sales_data. 
The correct way to define an object that uses the default constructor for initialization is to leave off the trailing, empty parentheses: 
// ok: obj is a default-initialized object 
Sales_data obj; 

Warning 
It is a common mistake among programmers new to C++ to try to declare an object initialized with the default constructor as follows: 
Sales_data obj(); // oops! declares a function, not an object Sales_data obj2; // ok: obj2 is an object, not a function 
Exercises Section 7.5.3 Exercise 7.43: Assume we have a class named NoDefault that has a constructor that takes an int, but has no default constructor. Define a class C that has a 
member of type NoDefault. Define the default constructor for C. Exercise 7.44: Is the following declaration legal? If 
not, why not? 
vector<NoDefault> vec(10); 
Exercise 7.45: What if we defined the vector in the previous execercise to hold objects of type C? 
Exercise 7.46: Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue? Why? 
(a) 
A class must provide at least one constructor. 

(b) 
A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list. 

(c) 
If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not provide a default constructor. 

(d) 
If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates one that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated type. 


7.5.4. Implicit Class-Type Conversions 

As we saw in ¬ß 4.11 
(p. 159), the language defines several automatic conversions among the built-in types. We also noted that classes can define implicit conversions as well. Every constructor that can be called with a single argument defines an implicit conversion to a class type. Such constructors are sometimes referred to as converting 
constructors. We'll see in ¬ß 
14.9 
(p. 579) how to define conversions from a class type to another type. 

Note 
A constructor that can be called with a single argument defines an implicit conversion from the constructor's parameter type to the class type. 
The Sales_data constructors that take a string and that take an istream both define implicit conversions from those types to Sales_data. That is, we can use a string or an istream where an object of type Sales_data is expected: 
string null_book = "9-999-99999-9"; // constructs a temporary Sales_data object // with units_sold and revenue equal to 0 and bookNo equal to null_book item.combine(null_book); 
Here we call the Sales_data combine member function with a string argument. This call is perfectly legal; the compiler automatically creates a Sales_data object from the given string. That newly generated (temporary) Sales_data is passed to combine. Because combine's parameter is a reference to const, we can pass a temporary to that parameter. 
Only One Class-Type Conversion Is Allowed 
In ¬ß 4.11.2 
(p. 162) we noted that the compiler will automatically apply only one class-type conversion. For example, the following code is in error because it implicitly uses two conversions: 
// error: requires two user-defined conversions: 
// (1) convert "9-999-99999-9" to string 
// (2) convert that (temporary) string to Sales_data 
item.combine("9-999-99999-9"); 
If we wanted to make this call, we can do so by explicitly converting the character string to either a string or a Sales_data object: 
// ok: explicit conversion to string, implicit conversion to Sales_data 
item.combine(string("9-999-99999-9")); 
// ok: implicit conversion to string, explicit conversion to Sales_data 
item.combine(Sales_data("9-999-99999-9")); 
Class-Type Conversions Are Not Always Useful 
Whether the conversion of a string to Sales_data is desired depends on how we think our users will use the conversion. In this case, it might be okay. The string in null_book probably represents a nonexistent ISBN. 
More problematic is the conversion from istream to Sales_data: 
// uses the istream constructor to build an object to pass to combine 
item.combine(cin); 
This code implicitly converts cin to Sales_data. This conversion executes the Sales_data constructor that takes an istream. That constructor creates a (temporary) Sales_data object by reading the standard input. That object is then passed to combine. 
This Sales_data object is a temporary (¬ß 2.4.1, p. 62). We have no access to it once combine finishes. Effectively, we have constructed an object that is discarded after we add its value into item. 
Suppressing Implicit Conversions Defined by Constructors 
We can prevent the use of a constructor in a context that requires an implicit conversion by declaring the constructor as explicit: 
class Sales_data { 
public: 
Sales_data() = default; 
Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p): 
bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { } 
explicit Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s) { } 
explicit Sales_data(std::istream&); 
// remaining members as before 
}; 
Now, neither constructor can be used to implicitly create a Sales_data object. Neither of our previous uses will compile: 
item.combine(null_book); // error: string constructor is explicit 
item.combine(cin); // error: istream constructor is explicit 
The explicit keyword is meaningful only on constructors that can be called with a single argument. Constructors that require more arguments are not used to perform an implicit conversion, so there is no need to designate such constructors as explicit. The explicit keyword is used only on the constructor declaration inside the class. It is not repeated on a definition made outside the class body: 
// error: explicit allowed only on a constructor declaration in a class header 
explicit Sales_data::Sales_data(istream& is) { read(is, *this); } 
explicit Constructors Can Be Used Only for Direct Initialization 
One context in which implicit conversions happen is when we use the copy form of initialization (with an =) (¬ß 3.2.1, p. 84). We cannot use an explicit constructor with this form of initialization; we must use direct initialization: 
Sales_data item1 (null_book); // ok: direct initialization // error: cannot use the copy form of initialization with an explicit constructor 
Sales_data item2 = null_book; 

Note 
When a constructor is declared explicit, it can be used only with the direct form of initialization (¬ß 3.2.1, p. 84). Moroever, the compiler will not use this constructor in an automatic conversion. 
Explicitly Using Constructors for Conversions 
Although the compiler will not use an explicit constructor for an implicit conversion, we can use such constructors explicitly to force a conversion: 
// ok: the argument is an explicitly constructed Sales_data object 
item.combine(Sales_data(null_book)); 
// ok: static_cast can use an explicit constructor 
item.combine(static_cast<Sales_data>(cin)); 
In the first call, we use the Sales_data constructor directly. This call constructs a temporary Sales_data object using the Sales_data constructor that takes a string. In the second call, we use a static_cast (¬ß 4.11.3, p. 163) to perform an explicit, rather than an implicit, conversion. In this call, the static_cast uses the istream constructor to construct a temporary Sales_data object. 
Library Classes with explicit Constructors 
Some of the library classes that we've used have single-parameter constructors: 
. 
The string constructor that takes a single parameter of type const char* (¬ß 3.2.1, p. 84) is not explicit. 

. 
The vector constructor that takes a size (¬ß 3.3.1, p. 98) is explicit. 


Exercises Section 7.5.4 Exercise 7.47: Explain whether the Sales_data constructor that takes a string should be explicit. What 
are the benefits of making the constructor explicit? What are the drawbacks? Exercise 7.48: Assuming the Sales_data constructors 
are not explicit, what operations happen during the following definitions 
string null_isbn("9-999-99999-9"); Sales_data item1(null_isbn); Sales_data item2("9-999-99999-9"); 
What happens if the Sales_data constructors are 
explicit? Exercise 7.49: For each of the three following declarations of combine, explain what happens if we call i.combine(s), where i is a Sales_data and s is a string: 
(a) 
Sales_data &combine(Sales_data); 

(b) 
Sales_data &combine(Sales_data&); 

(c) 
Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&) const; 


Exercise 7.50: Determine whether any of your Person 
class constructors should be explicit. Exercise 7.51: Why do you think vector defines its single-argument constructor as explicit, but string does not? 
7.5.5. Aggregate Classes 

An aggregate 
class 
gives users direct access to its members and has special initialization syntax. A class is an aggregate if 
. 
All of its data members are public 

. 
It does not define any constructors 

. 
It has no in-class initializers (¬ß 2.6.1, p. 73) 

. 
It has no base classes or virtual functions, which are 


class-related features that we'll cover in Chapter 
15 
For example, the following class is an aggregate: 
struct Data { int ival; 
string s; 
}; 
We can initialize the data members of an aggregate class by providing a braced list of member initializers: 
// val1.ival = 0; val1.s = string("Anna") 
Data val1 = { 0, "Anna" }; The initializers must appear in declaration order of the data members. That is, the initializer for the first member is first, for the second is next, and so on. The following, for example, is an error: 
// error: can't use "Anna" to initialize ival, or 1024 to initialize s 
Data val2 = { "Anna", 1024 }; As with initialization of array elements (¬ß 3.5.1, p. 114), if the list of initializers has fewer elements than the class has members, the trailing members are value initialized (¬ß 3.5.1, p. 114). The list of initializers must not contain more elements than the class has members. 
It is worth noting that there are three significant drawbacks to explicitly initializing the members of an object of class type: 
. 
It requires that all the data members of the class be public. 

. 
It puts the burden on the user of the class (rather than on the class author) to correctly initialize every member of every object. Such initialization is tedious and error-prone because it is easy to forget an initializer or to supply an inappropriate initializer. 

. 
If a member is added or removed, all initializations have to be updated. 


Exercises Section 7.5.5 Exercise 7.52: Using our first version of Sales_data from ¬ß 
2.6.1 
(p. 72), explain the following initialization. Identify and fix any problems. 
Sales_data item = {"978-0590353403", 25, 15.99}; 
7.5.6. Literal Classes 

In ¬ß 6.5.2 
(p. 239) we noted that the parameters and return type of a constexpr function must be literal types. In addition to the arithmetic types, references, and pointers, certain classes are also literal types. Unlike other classes, classes that are literal types may have function members that are constexpr. Such members must meet all the requirements of a constexpr function. These member functions are implicitly const (¬ß 7.1.2, p. 258). 
An aggregate class (¬ß 7.5.5, p. 298) whose data members are all of literal type is a literal class. A nonaggregate class, that meets the following restrictions, is also a literal class: 
. 
The data members all must have literal type. 

. 
The class must have at least one constexpr constructor. 

. 
If a data member has an in-class initializer, the initializer for a member of built-in type must be a constant expression (¬ß 2.4.4, p. 65), or if the member has class type, the initializer must use the member's own constexpr constructor. 

. 
The class must use default definition for its destructor, which is the member that destroys objects of the class type (¬ß 7.1.5, p. 267). 


constexpr Constructors 
Although constructors can't be const (¬ß 7.1.4, p. 262), 
constructors in a literal class can be constexpr (¬ß 6.5.2, p. 239) functions. Indeed, a literal class must provide at least one constexpr constructor. 

A constexpr constructor can be declared as = default (¬ß 7.1.4, p. 
264) (or as a deleted function, which we cover in ¬ß 13.1.6 
(p. 507)). Otherwise, a constexpr constructor must meet the requirements of a constructor'meaning it can have no return statement'and of a constexpr function'meaning the only executable statement it can have is a return statement (¬ß 6.5.2, 
p. 239). As a result, the body of a constexpr constructor is typically empty. We define a constexpr constructor by preceding its declaration with the keyword constexpr: 
class Debug { public: constexpr Debug(bool b = true): hw(b), io(b), other(b) { } constexpr Debug(bool h, bool i, bool o): hw(h), io(i), other(o) { 
} constexpr bool any() { return hw || io || other; } void set_io(bool b) { io = b; } void set_hw(bool b) { hw = b; } void set_other(bool b) { hw = b; } 
private: bool hw; // hardware errors other than IO errors bool io; // IO errors bool other; // other errors 
}; 
A constexpr constructor must initialize every data member. The initializers must either use a constexpr constructor or be a constant expression. 
A constexpr constructor is used to generate objects that are constexpr and for parameters or return types in constexpr functions: 
constexpr Debug io_sub(false, true, false); // debugging IO if (io_sub.any()) // equivalent to if(true) 
cerr << "print appropriate error messages" << endl; constexpr Debug prod(false); // no debugging during production if (prod.any()) // equivalent to if(false) 
cerr << "print an error message" << endl; 
Exercises Section 7.5.6 Exercise 7.53: Define your own version of Debug. Exercise 7.54: Should the members of Debug that begin 
with set_ be declared as constexpr? If not, why not? Exercise 7.55: Is the Data class from ¬ß 7.5.5 
(p. 298) a literal class? If not, why not? If so, explain why it is literal. 
7.6. static Class Members 
Classes sometimes need members that are associated with the class, rather than with individual objects of the class type. For example, a bank account class might need a data member to represent the current prime interest rate. In this case, we'd want to associate the rate with the class, not with each individual object. From an efficiency standpoint, there'd be no reason for each object to store the rate. Much more importantly, if the rate changes, we'd want each object to use the new value. 
Declaring static Members 
We say a member is associated with the class by adding the keyword static to its declaration. Like any other member, static members can be public or private. The type of a static data member can be const, reference, array, class type, and so forth. 
As an example, we'll define a class to represent an account record at a bank: 
class Account { 
public: 
void calculate() { amount += amount * interestRate; } 
static double rate() { return interestRate; } 
static void rate(double); 
private: 
std::string owner; 
double amount; 
static double interestRate; 
static double initRate(); 
}; 
The static members of a class exist outside any object. Objects do not contain data associated with static data members. Thus, each Account object will contain two data members'owner and amount. There is only one interestRate object that will be shared by all the Account objects. 
Similarly, static member functions are not bound to any object; they do not have a this pointer. As a result, static member functions may not be declared as const, and we may not refer to this in the body of a static member. This restriction applies both to explicit uses of this and to implicit uses of this by calling a nonstatic member. 
Using a Class static Member 
We can access a static member directly through the scope operator: 
double r; r = Account::rate(); // access a static member using the scope operator 
Even though static members are not part of the objects of its class, we can use an object, reference, or pointer of the class type to access a static member: 
Account ac1; 
Account *ac2 = &ac1; 
// equivalent ways to call the static member rate function 
r = ac1.rate(); // through an Account object or reference 
r = ac2->rate(); // through a pointer to an Account object 
Member functions can use static members directly, without the scope operator: 
class Account { 
public: 
void calculate() { amount += amount * interestRate; } 
private: 
static double interestRate; 
// remaining members as before 
}; 
Defining static Members 
As with any other member function, we can define a static member function inside or outside of the class body. When we define a static member outside the class, we do not repeat the static keyword. The keyword appears only with the declaration inside the class body: 
void Account::rate(double newRate) { interestRate = newRate; } 

Note 
As with any class member, when we refer to a class static member outside the class body, we must specify the class in which the member is defined. The static keyword, however, is used only on the declaration inside the class body. 
Because static data members are not part of individual objects of the class type, they are not defined when we create objects of the class. As a result, they are not initialized by the class' constructors. Moreover, in general, we may not initialize a static member inside the class. Instead, we must define and initialize each static data member outside the class body. Like any other object, a static data member may be defined only once. 
Like global objects (¬ß 6.1.1, p. 204), static data members are defined outside any function. Hence, once they are defined, they continue to exist until the program completes. 
We define a static data member similarly to how we define class member functions outside the class. We name the object's type, followed by the name of the class, the scope operator, and the member's own name: 
// define and initialize a static class member 
double Account::interestRate = initRate(); This statement defines the object named interestRate that is a static member of class Account and has type double. Once the class name is seen, the remainder of the definition is in the scope of the class. As a result, we can use initRate without qualification as the initializer for rate. Note also that even though initRate is private, we can use this function to initialize interestRate. The definition of interestRate, like any other member definition, has access to the private members of the class. 

Tip 
The best way to ensure that the object is defined exactly once is to put the definition of static data members in the same file that contains the definitions of the class noninline member functions. 
In-Class Initialization of static Data Members 
Ordinarily, class static members may not be initialized in the class body. However, we can provide in-class initializers for static members that have const integral type and must do so for static members that are constexprs of literal type (¬ß 7.5.6, 
p. 299). The initializers must be constant expressions. Such members are themselves constant expressions; they can be used where a constant expression is required. For example, we can use an initialized static data member to specify the dimension of an array member: 
class Account { 
public: 
static double rate() { return interestRate; } static void rate(double); private: static constexpr int period = 30;// period is a constant expression 
double daily_tbl[period]; }; 
If the member is used only in contexts where the compiler can substitute the member's value, then an initialized const or constexpr static need not be separately defined. However, if we use the member in a context in which the value cannot be substituted, then there must be a definition for that member. 
For example, if the only use we make of period is to define the dimension of daily_tbl, there is no need to define period outside of Account. However, if we omit the definition, it is possible that even seemingly trivial changes to the program might cause the program to fail to compile because of the missing definition. For example, if we pass Account::period to a function that takes a const int&, then period must be defined. 
If an initializer is provided inside the class, the member's definition must not specify an initial value: 
// definition of a static member with no initializer constexpr int Account::period; // initializer provided in the class definition 

Best Practices 
Even if a const static data member is initialized in the class body, that member ordinarily should be defined outside the class definition. 
static Members Can Be Used in Ways Ordinary Members Can't 
As we've seen, static members exist independently of any other object. As a result, they can be used in ways that would be illegal for nonstatic data members. As one example, a static data member can have incomplete type (¬ß 7.3.3, p. 278). In particular, a static data member can have the same type as the class type of which it is a member. A nonstatic data member is restricted to being declared as a pointer or a reference to an object of its class: 
class Bar { public: // ... private: static Bar mem1; // ok: static member can have incomplete type Bar *mem2; // ok: pointer member can have incomplete type Bar mem3; // error: data members must have complete type }; 
Another difference between static and ordinary members is that we can use a static member as a default argument (¬ß 6.5.1, p. 236): 
class Screen { public: // bkground refers to the static member // declared later in the class definition Screen& clear(char = bkground); private: static const char bkground; }; 
A nonstatic data member may not be used as a default argument because its value is part of the object of which it is a member. Using a nonstatic data member as a default argument provides no object from which to obtain the member's value and so is an error.

Chapter Summary 
Classes are the most fundamental feature in C++. Classes let us define new types for our applications, making our programs shorter and easier to modify. 
Data abstraction'the ability to define both data and function members'and encapsulation'the ability to protect class members from general access'are fundamental to classes. We encapsulate a class by defining its implementation members as private. Classes may grant access to their nonpublic member by designating another class or function as a friend. 
Classes may define constructors, which are special member functions that control how objects are initialized. Constructors may be overloaded. Constructors should use a constructor initializer list to initialize all the data members. 
Classes may also define mutable or static members. A mutable member is a data member that is never const; its value may be changed inside a const member function. A static member can be either function or data; static members exist independently of the objects of the class type. 
Defined Terms 
abstract 
data 
type 
Data structure that encapsulates (hides) its implementation. 
access 
specifier 
Keywords public and private. Used to define whether members are accessible to users of the class or only to friends and members of the class. Specifiers may appear multiple times within a class. Each specifier sets the access of the following members up to the next specifier. 
aggregate 
class 
Class with only public data members that has no in-class initializers or constructors. Members of an aggregate can be initialized by a brace-enclosed list of initializers. 
class 
C++ mechanism for defining our own abstract data types. Classes may have data, function, or type members. A class defines a new type and a new scope. 
class declaration The keyword class (or struct) followed by the class name followed by a semicolon. If a class is declared but not defined, it is an incomplete type. 
class 
keyword 
Keyword used to define a class; by default members are private. 
class scope Each class defines a scope. Class scopes are more complicated than other scopes'member functions defined within the class body may use names that appear even after the definition. 
const 
member 
function 
A member function that may not change an object's ordinary (i.e., neither static nor mutable) data members. The this pointer in a const member is a pointer to const. A member function may be overloaded based on whether the function is const. 
constructor 
A special member function used to initialize objects. Each constructor should give each data member a well-defined initial value. 
constructor 
initializer 
list 
Specifies initial values of the data members of a class. The members are initialized to the values specified in the initializer list before the body of the constructor executes. Class members that are not initialized in the initializer list are default initialized. 
converting 
constructor 
A nonexplicit constructor that can be called with a single argument. Such constructors implicitly convert from the argument's type to the class type. 
data 
abstraction 
Programming technique that focuses on the interface to a type. Data abstraction lets programmers ignore the details of how a type is represented and think instead about the operations that the type can perform. Data abstraction is fundamental to both object-oriented and generic programming. 
default 
constructor 
Constructor that is used if no initializer is supplied. 
delegating 
constructor 
Constructor with a constructor-initializer list that has one entry that designates another constructor of the same class to do the initialization. 
encapsulation 
Separation of implementation from interface; encapsulation hides the implementation details of a type. In C++, encapsulation is enforced by putting the implementation in the private part of a class. 
explicit constructor Constructor that can be called with a single argument but cannot be used in an implicit conversion. A constructor is made explicit by prepending the keyword explicit to its declaration. 
forward 
declaration 
Declaration of an as yet undefined 
name. Most often used to refer to the declaration of a class that appears prior to the definition of that class. See incomplete type. 
friend 
Mechanism by which a class grants access to its nonpublic members. Friends have the same access rights as members. Both classes and functions may be named as friends. 
implementation 
The (usually private) members of a class that define the data and any operations that are not intended for use by code that uses the type. 
incomplete 
type 
Type that is declared but not defined. It is not possible to use an incomplete type to define a variable or class member. It is legal to define references or pointers to incomplete types. 
interface 
The (public) operations supported by a type. Ordinarily, the interface does not include data members. 
member 
function 
Class member that is a function. Ordinary member functions are bound to an object of the class type through the implicit this pointer. static member functions are not bound to an object and have no this pointer. Member functions may be overloaded; when they are, the implicit this pointer participates in the function matching. 
mutable 
data 
member 
Data member that is never const, even when it is a member of a const object. A mutable member can be changed inside a const function. 
name 
lookup 
Process by which the use of a name is matched to its declaration. 
private members Members defined after a private access specifier; accessible only to the friends and other class members. Data members and utility functions used by the class that are not part of the type's interface are usually declared private. 
public members Members defined after a public access specifier; accessible to any user of the class. Ordinarily, only the functions that define the interface to the class should be defined in the public sections. 
struct keyword Keyword used to define a class; by default members are public. 
synthesized 
default 
constructor 
The default constructor created (synthesized) by the compiler for classes that do not explicitly define any constructors. This constructor initializes the data members from their in-class initializers, if present; otherwise it default initializes the data members. 
this 
pointer 
Implicit value passed as an extra argument to every nonstatic member function. The this pointer points to the object on which the function is invoked. 
= 
default 
Syntax used after the parameter list of the declaration of the default constructor inside a class to signal to the compiler that it should generate the constructor, even if the class has other constructors.
